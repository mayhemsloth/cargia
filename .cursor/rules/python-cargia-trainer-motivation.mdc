# Cargia Trainer

Initially, Cargia was going to be only the GUI used to create the training dataset, and then I would do the model training in Python (very likely Gemma3 through the transformers package) locally with my 4090 just in code like I normally do for model training. However, as I started to label data I realized that it would be extremely useful to have a GUI that can display examples during training, to quickly evaluate the model’s outputs and where it might be getting things incorrect or correct. This is the same type of feedback that I find very useful in training segmentation models: being able to visually, at a glance, see how the model is performing is very useful during training. Training a model to solve ARC-AGI puzzles is a little different than training a segmentation model where the totality of the abilities can be summarized with a single image. Although arguably the totality of the ARC-AGI specific model’s performance can also be summarized with a single image (the output grid of the test pair, transformed into the image representation using the color map). 

So the plan now is to make an entirely different tab or section of the GUI that is a “Training” screen. This training screen should contain the following features:

1. The ability to set the training configuration settings for a training run.
2. Be able to kick off a training run script with a button within the GUI.
3. If a run is happening, the ability to see examples of the model’s thoughts output and final output grid test pair guess in the GUI very similar to the one that I use to collect the data. That is, I want to be able to visually see the color map reference, the grids transformed into images, and the text box of the thoughts below each pair. The test pair will be handled differently, as the output should not be the answer but it should be the model’s inference. Additionally, there should be some easy way to tell whether the model’s inference was correct or incorrect, and how badly it was incorrect (for example was the grid size correct is the simplest to check for generic understanding of the pair, and then how many tiles was it off by. )
    1. Note that this might necessitate creating a database for randomly saving training set/validation set inference data, and then I can load the examples to be shown in the GUI. This functionality does not yet exist in Cargia, but should be pretty easy to add.
4. I’ll probably integrate TensorBoard into Cursor anyway, so I don’t think that is necessary to show in the GUI during training.

Other functionalities that I need to absolutely nail down in preparation for training and data augmentation during training:

1. The “cleaned” data processing pass. The current thoughts text data saved in each individual box is not very “clean” due to the state of the local transcription model output. I plan on using a local LLM, probably Gemma3 itself, to do a permanent single pass that would produce a new column in the thoughts database which is the “cleaned” data, which is simply a grammatically correct and punctuation-correct version of the raw thoughts data. This column would then actually be used during training. This cleaning pass should not touch any of the actual content of the text boxes, basically, just clean it up to make it actually appropriate to teach an LLM.
2. The static prompt I give to Gemma3 in preparation to actually become a ARC-AGI solver. It should address the task at hand, and some of the concepts and vocabulary that it should expect to encounter in the puzzles. 
    1. Static prompt draft:
    
    ```
    // put static prompt here
    ```
    
3. The production of the GridImage that will then be encoded by Gemma3. This should be **the same code** that I am using in Cargia for data collection as it is for what I’m giving to Gemma3. **There may be some resolution issues** that may need to be addressed due to how the vision encoder works in Gemma3, but we’ll see how goes initially. 
4. The data augmentation techniques. There are two primary ones that I want to implement for sure because I’m fairly confident I can do it in an easy way. 
    1. **Color invariance**. The colors that are chosen to be presented in the GridImage are completely arbitrary and have no inherent meaning to solving the puzzles. I have it coded already for the GridImages to be constructed based on a given color map, which maps the symbols (in the standard format, those symbols are the digits 0 to 9) in the JSON file to colors in the GridImage. However that doesn’t mean that I should *fully randomize* the color maps. We want color maps to have the following properties:
        1. The ten colors should be pair-wise meaningfully distinguishable by vision inspection. If a human would get confused, at a glance, between any two colors, then they are not meaningfully distinguishable. 
        2. The ten colors should collectively have relatively common English names so that it is easy for the language model (and a human child) to describe them in English in a meaningfully distinguishable way. For example, I would probably not prefer “dark blue” and “light blue” as different enough. But perhaps? Here are the list of colors that I think I would want to include: 
            1. white, black, gray, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, pink, aqua. Gold maybe? Magenta maybe?
        3. Note that the grid lines will be white throughout all the color mappings, so I’m not sure about including white. Maybe the grid lines could be a slight off white so there’s still contrast between the white tile and the white boundary of the grid. 
    2. **Character invariance**. The characters themselves that used to represent the text grids in the JSON format also do not have inherent meaning. The default are the digits 0 to 9, but the model should learn about the connections between these characters and not anything to do with the characters themselves. To obliterate any type of connection to the actual characters when solving these tasks, you could easily use any alphanumeric characters, including symbols, and we probably should plan to do exactly that as a data augmentation technique.
    3. Note that with **character invariance** there is no need to touch the thoughts data because the thoughts data never references the underlying characters, because I do not see the characters at all because they have been translated to a visual grid image with colors! Of course I will have to transform the input and target JSON information because the model output and whether that output is correct is determined solely based on the characters in the correct order. With **color invariance**, I absolutely will need to transform the target thoughts data, because there are colors referenced throughout the thoughts data constantly (of course). So I need a **robust method** to replace the colors that are mapped from one character to that color (according to the color map) in the original thoughts text. I’m not sure if a simple find and replace would work? Probably? But I should ensure that the function behaves how I think it should on a bunch of test cases before I fully trust it. I need to be very clear about what the model is seeing and what the training data looks like because I don’t want to be confusing the model at all! This necessitates, which I was already planning on doing, a “Viewer” part of Cargia that simply allows me to view the exact data that is in a database entry. 
    4. The other data augmentations relate to the metadata tags, but those are much harder to transform the thoughts data for, so I’m not sure if I am going to try to pull it off, at least initially. The primary metadata tags that I would try to implement are rotational, vertical mirror, and horizontal mirror symmetries. When describing the grids, I very often refer to directional edges or specific rows and columns. Any type of directional description would need to be changed to the corresponding directional description. For example, if I rotate a task by 90 degrees clockwise, then a right edge becomes a bottom edge, and also columns become rows (and vice verse) which is tricky. I almost would have to use an LLM itself (likely Gemma3) to transform the data as a preprocessing step in the data augmentation, because I don’t think there’s any other way to get all the nuances in the text to be correct transformed. Even with an LLM, I’m not sure how reliable this type of transformation would be. But the point is, many many puzzles have these metadata labels on them, so it would be really nice to be able to teach the model about grid spatial invariance for the puzzles that exhibit those types of invariance. These augmentations definitely feel like they are “expanding the dataset” more than the other two augmentations, but it is still a type of invariance that the model can learn about and thus get rid of any inherent bias that might not be true in the harder tests. 
5. The exact sequence of data entry with the “conversation” between the model and the user feeding it the new puzzles. I gathered the thoughts data in roughly the same method that I imagined the sequence would go with the model. Cargia, during data collection, shows one of the training pairs and then asks for thoughts on that training pair. For the first pair, I would almost always comment on the relative sizes of the grids immediately, because that give s strong hint as to what type of puzzle we are dealing with. That’s the first piece of useful information. Then I would often, for the first pair, comment on both the input and output grid and directly describe their visual contents, and then construct a hypothesis if I was confident enough to do so. The point of this process was to try to reason out immediately at least some type of guess, and then the future training pairs could refer back to this hypothesis and either support it or amend it or throw it out altogether because it was wrong. Once the next training pair was shown, then a new thoughts response was prompted and I added my thoughts, which would obviously reference the *previous* thoughts text from the other training pairs. Finally, I would be aware that any test pair has showed up, and then my thoughts data would be a little bit different and more specific, repeating the hypothesis clearly and somewhat directly addressing the output grid construction more than other training pairs. 
     However by nature of the text and image version that I will want to give to the model, and because the ARC-AGI model’s answer is predicated on the final text string only, there’s a few tweaks that I might want to make. See the next point for more in-depth discussion on this. 

6. The evaluation code during training. Initially, I was thinking that the LLM would be trained in the typical next token prediction fashion, and thus probably I wouldn’t have to do any type of custom code for setting up Gemma3 fine tune training, because I’m pretty sure someone has already done that. However, there is also the consideration that ARC-AGI tests are all or nothing. Either one of your attempts is EXACTLY correct for each character in the grid, or it is entirely wrong. I’m sure there are measurements of closeness to the correct answer, but that isn’t what matters. During training of course the model will need to accurately predict the grid in text form in the test pairs for each task, and the ground truth answer of the output grid in text form will be supplied, but then that part is weighted *the same* as accurately predicting any other part of the thoughts text. I’m not sure if that’s what I actually want though. This situation is very similar to the concept “Intermediate Supervision” in a object segmentation paper. It was a typical UNet model architecture, but they supplemented the final mask loss with other losses associated with intermediate side outputs from inside the model. In this way, the model is trying to learn that it needs to be “on the correct path” to getting the right answer, and that that “correct path” is *just as important* as the final answer. In our case, we are teaching the model that the *reasoning* contained in the sequencing of the thoughts text ground truth is *just as important* as the final answer of the text grid output. In reality, that isn’t quite the case. The model could figure out any method to get to the correct answer, and perhaps it is not through the type of reasoning that I am trying to impose on the model. I will have to come back to this to better understand how I might weight the final test output answer(s) with respect to the rest of the components.
