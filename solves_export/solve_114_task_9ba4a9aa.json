    "a": "Input and output grids are drastically different sizes. Input grid has a large grid with an aqua color background and a bunch of 3 by 3 square objects scattered throughout. It seems like there are corrupted paths that are connecting these square objects, and the corrupted path is made up of different colors in different section. The output grid is a 3 by 3 square, which is probably related to one of the 3 by 3 squares in the input grid. Indeed we see that the output grid is an exact copy of one of the five 3x3 squares that are found in the input grid. Because of the drastically different input and output grid sizes, and because of the exact copy of an object as the output grid, it seems like there must be some type of selection rule from the content of the input grid that tells us which square or object to select as being the answer as the output grid. In this case, we see the selection rule selected the pink square with the orange interior. Looking at the rest of the other squares, three of them have a solid color boundary layer or bounding box, with a different color center, but one of them has a checkboard like pattern with no solid color boundary layer. We notice that the corrupted path that connects this checkboard patterned 3x3 square to the pink bnoundary layer object is the only path that stays the same color from one square object to the other. In this case, that color is green. This seems to be the selection rule. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be a large grid with some color background. The input grid will contain some number of 3x3 square objects that will be connected by corrupted, or every other missing tiles, paths. In order to construct the output grid, we need to apply the selection rule to select the appropriate 3x3 square and simply copy over that object as the output grid. The selection rule tells us to find the square with the solid boundary layer that is connected by a single color corrupted path to the checkboard pattern square. Basically the checkboard pattern square object is the start of the selector path.",
    "b": "The input and output gris are again drastically different sizes. The input grid is a large grid of red background and 5 instances of 3x3 square objects with corrupted paths of different colors connecting them to each other. Accoring to the hypothesis, In order to construct the output grid, we need to first apply the selection rule. After we've applied the selection rule, we simply copy over the selected 3x3 square object into the output grid as our answer. The selection rule tells us to inspect the square objects in the input grid and identify the one with the checkerboard pattern. In this case, that pattern object is in the top left corner of the input grid with an aqua and blue checkerboard. The selection rule tells us that the corrupted path that extends from this checkerboard square and ends with Some other square is the square that is selected to be copied over to the output grid. In this case, the yellow corrupted path leads us to the green boundary layer square with the blue center tile, so that is the selected 3x3 square object. Because the output grid is exactly this square object, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "As expected the input and output grids are drastically different sizes. The input grid has a blue color background and 5 instances of 3x3 square objects of various colors. There are also corrupted paths of different colors connecting these square objects to each other. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid we need to apply the selection rule and then simply copy over the selected square object into the output grid as our answer. The selection rules tells us to inspect the square objects in the input grid and identify the one with the checkboard pattern. In this case that is the green and pink colored square in the bottom left of the input grid. The selection rule then tells us that the corrupted path that extends from this checkerboard square and ends with some other square while being a single color, in this case aqua, is the selected square object. In this case, the yellow boundary layer square with the pink center tile is the square object that is at the end of the aqua corrupted path, so that is the selected square object. Because the output grid is exactly this square object, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a yellow color background with some number of 3x3 square objects of varying colors. In this case, there are 6 such objects. The input grid also contains corrupted paths of various colors that connect the squares to each other. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to apply the selection rule and then copy over the selected square object into the output grid as the answer. The selection rules tells us to inspect the input grid and find the checkboard patterned 3x3 square object. In this case, that object is in the bottom right of the input grid and is aqua and purple. Then we need to follow the corrupted path that connects to this checkerboard square, in this case the blue corrupted path, until it ends at a different 3x3 square object, and that square object is the selected square to be copied over to the output grid. In this case, the blue path ends at the red boundary layer square with an aqua center tile, and thus the output grid should be a 3x3 tile grid with red on the outside layer and a single aqua tile in the center."
