In the input we see a background of aqua tiles. and some random-like object of purple tiles, specifically nine tiles in total. In the output grid, we see that there Nine purple tiles aligned in a single horizontal line centered in both the X and Y axes. My hypothesis is that The input grid will be some single colored background. with assorted, scattered tiles all of a single color And we must place those scattered single color tiles into a line centered in the output grid.",
    "b": "We have a input grid with an aqua background again and an object. of green tiles, specifically six green tiles. The upper grid also has six green tiles all aligned in a horizontal line centered in both the X and Y axes. in the middle of the output grid. input grid and output grid are the same sizes again with respect to each other So the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "Input grid is a different size, but it's still the same size as the output grid. The background color is aqua. And we see a scattered number of red tiles. specifically 15 red tiles. and notice in the output that there are 15 red tiles, all aligned horizontally in the center row, with the same number of rows above it and below it. Note that because the output grid also happens to be 15 tiles wide, the red horizontal line fills up the entirety of that center row, so it is still technically following the hypothesis of being centered in both row and columns.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid and the output grid should be the same sizes. The background is still aqua in input, so it will be aqua in the output grid. we identify In the input grid, a scattered number of gray tiles, in this case, 14 gray tiles. Therefore, according to the hypothesis, we must align these 14 gray tiles into a single horizontal line centered in the output grid. Since the input grid has 11 rows, the output grid will also have 11 rows, and we want to place the Horizontal gray line. in the middle row of these 11 rows, so the sixth from the top. The horizontal gray line should also be centered with respect to the left and right edges. Because there are 14 grade tiles and the output grid should have 28 columns, which is the same as the input grid, we know that There must be seven tiles of aqua before 14 tiles of gray and then seven tiles of aqua again, all located in the middle row. This would force the constructed horizontal gray line to be centered in both the rows and the columns."
