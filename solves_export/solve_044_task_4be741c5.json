    "a": "The input and output grid are very different sizes. We notice that the input grid has three distinct colors and the output grid also has three distinct colors and only three tiles vertically. Our hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be some size with some number of distinct colored sections. In this case, we have Red, aqua, and gray stacking on top of each other. the output grid is simply a representation of the distinct colors that appear in the input grid, no matter how large they are, compressed down to a single tile. In this case, the top tile in the output grid is red, the middle tile is aqua, and the bottom tile is gray. representing the distinct sections in the input grid of red aqua and grey.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are again very different sizes In this case, we see the input grid has three distinct sections. of yellow and then red and then aqua. in a horizontal fashion. the output grid is thus a three wide tile grid, with one tile tall, representing a super compressed version of the input grid. we've essentially shrunk the entire input grid down to single tile sections. Because generally, the input grid sections are aligned horizontally, the output grid is also aligned horizontally. that is the boundaries of the colors of the input grid are vertical Therefore, the directionality of the colors is horizontal, as there are, generally, vertical sections or blobs in the input grid. that the hypothesis holds. We need to identify the directionality and the distinct sections in the input grid. that directionality and the distinct colors and sections will dictate the size of the output grid.",
    "c": "The input grid has four distinct colors in it and four distinct sections of those colors. The top section is pink, the next section below that is yellow, the next section below that is red, and the next section below that is green. Thus, according to the hypothesis, we compress all of these sections down into a single column. with four rows. denoting the four distinct Sections of colors. The output grid should thus be a single column of pink, yellow, red, and blue tiles, and that is what we see in the output grid. Thus the hypothesis holds. Note that although we haven't seen such an example, we may encounter an example where there are sections that are both horizontal and vertical, which would necessitate the output grid being some type of multi-column and multi-row output grid.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid consists of four distinct sections, that are generally vertical sections. Going from left to right we have a green section, then a red section, then a blue section, then an aqua section. According to the hypothesis, we need to compress these sections down to single tile representations, in the orientation of their direction. Because the boundaries are vertical, it means that the boundaries in the output grid will also be columns. Thus, we have in the output grid a single row with four columns representing the four distinct colored sections. The leftmost tile will be green, then the next tile will be red, and the next tile will be blue, and the next last tile will be aqua, all in a single row. That is the entirety of the output grid."
