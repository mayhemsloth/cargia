The input grid has Two columns of orange, one on the left edge and one on the right edge. and then a checkerboard-like pattern in the middle two columns of green and aqua. The output grid looks like a type of transformation. that has aligned the aqua. tiles into a single column. Specifically, one transformation that might have occurred is the second and fourth row from the top has been wrapped around to the right. For example, let's take the second row. We have orange, aqua, green, orange. If we wrap the second row to the right, move it one tile. The orange at the end will show up at the start. Therefore, you have orange, orange. Aqua green, which is what is in the output grid. If this same wrapping is done with the last row, then that's how you end up with the output grid. My current hypothesis is that you have to wrap around the second and fourth rows or perhaps even the even rows of the input grid. by one tile in order to get to the output grid. I'm not too confident with this hypothesis though, so I'd like to see another pair to confirm.",
    "b": "We now have another input and output grid of the same size, but this time they are 6x6. see that we have a big chunk of orange in a checkerboard-like grid of black and gray. the hypothesis seems to hold here. If we take every even row and wrap around that row such that we move it to the right one tile and wrap whatever falls off the edge of the input grid for that row. then we end up with the output grid. For example, Looking at the second row The last tile is orange. Therefore, if we move the entire row to the right, orange tile that would have fallen off the grid and instead placed it in the first column in the output grid. we would end up with the correct second row. If we do this with every even numbered row, we end up with the correct output grid. We keep the odd rows the same.",
    "c": "We applied the hypothesis here. They have a background of orange again. Let's assume that we must start wrapping the rows with every second row only when there are valid non-background color entries in that row. For this input grid, we therefore identify the second row of the pattern and wrap the row to the right, aligning the purple tiles in a vertical line after moving both the purple and the red tiles to the right. The orange tiles gets wrapped around. Because that's the only even row in the structure of the checkboard tile pattern, that's the only change we make, and the rest of the output grid stays the same as the input grid."
