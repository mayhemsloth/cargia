The input grid has a couple of yellow objects on a black color background. The output grid also has these yellow objects located in the same location. However, in the output grid, orange tiles have been added to the shape of the object such that it is now turned into a 3x3 square when considering both the yellow and orange tiles. Thus hypothesis is the following. Input grid will have a black color background with some number of objects scattered among it. These objects will likely be a shape of some color such that the shape has a bounding box that is a three by three. That is, the shape can be placed entirely into a three by three square. In order to construct the output grid, we need to add orange color tiles to the exact tiles that are needed to be filled in to construct this 3x3 square. The output grid is an exact copy of the input grid with the exception of these tiles that are filled in and changed to orange.",
    "b": "the input grid is again a black color background with two yellow objects of different shapes. According to the hypothesis, for each of these yellow shapes, they should be able to fit into a 3x3 mounting box, which they both can be. orange tiles such that it fills in the missing pieces of each of the yellow shapes, and this filled in shape of yellow and orange now define a 3x3 square. The output grid indeed shows exactly this, so the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "we apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black color background and two yellow objects. These yellow objects are of some shape such that a 3x3 bounding box could contain them. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to fill in the missing tiles of the yellow shaped objects with orangel tiles such that it would form a three by three square. The rest of the input grid is copied over exactly as is, with the exception of these additional orange tiles in the correct location within the bounding box of the yellow shapes to fill in the yellow objects and complete them as squares."
