    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid contains a variety of different shaped black rectangle objects that seem to be embedded in a gray color background. There are also some scattered single blue and red tiles that are adjacent to the black rectangles, seemingly at random. There are 7 total blue tiles and 5 total red tiles. The output grid is similar to the input grid, except that the output grid has no black rectangles anymore, and all the black tiles have been changed to either red or blue color tiles. The rest of the output grid is exactly the same as the input grid. One black rectangle change to red, and five of the black rectangles changed to blue. How do we determine which color each black rectangle should be changed to? We notice in the input grid that some number of blue and red tiles border each black rectangle. For example, the top left black rectangle is bordered by two blue tiles and one red tile and it was changed to blue in the output grid. The top middle black rectangle was bordered by three blue tiles and one red tile and it was change to blue color in the output grid. The bottom middle black rectangle was bordered by three red tiles and zero blue tiles and it was changed to red. This pattern seems to establish that each black rectangle changes color in the output grid to the color that had the most number of tiles of that color surrounding that rectangle in the input grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some number of black rectangles on a probably gray colored background. Bordering each black rectangle will be some number of blue or red tiles, or perhaps some other non-background and non black color. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is but change all the black rectangles to their selected colors. The appropriate color to select is based on the color of tiles surrounding each rectangle that has the most number of tiles surrounding each rectangle. All other tiles in the output grid stay the same as the input grid, with the exception of change the colors of the black tiles. Note that we do not know how to handle the case of a tie for the most number of tiles of two or more different colors surrounding the black rectangle, perhaps we will learn in later training pairs.",
    "b": "The input grid contains six differently shaped black rectangle objects that are on a gray color background. There are also scattered single blue and single red tiles that are adjacent to the black rectangles, bordering them seemingly at random. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is, with the exception of changing all of the black rectangle objects to their appropriate selected colors. To determine which color each black rectangle should be changed to, we need to count, for each rectangle, the surrounding single color tiles and find the color that has the highest number of tiles. In this case, for example, the top left black rectangle in the input grid should changed to blue in the output grid because it has two blue tiles bordering it and only one red tile. The bottom left rectangle should be changed to red because it has two red tiles bordering it and only one blue tile. This color selection rule is applied to all the black rectangles individually. No other tiles are changed in the output grid besides the color of the black rectangles. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid contains nine black rectangle objects that are on a gray color background. There are also scattered single blue and single red tiles that are adjacent to the black rectangles, bordering the rectangles seemingly at random. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is, with the exception of changing all of the black rectangle objects to their appropriate selected colors. To determine which color each black rectangle should be changed to, we need to count for each rectangle the surrounding single color tiles and find the color that has the highest number of tiles. We apply this color selection rule individually for each of the nine black rectangle objects to determine which color, in this case blue or red, each rectangle should be changed to. No other tiles are changed in the output grid besides the color of the black rectangles to their appropriate colors. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect, the hypothsis holds. We note that every rectangle has still had a strict winner and no ties for the most number of tiles surrounding any rectangle, so we assume that there will not be any ties.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains nine black rectangle objects that are on a gray color background. There are also scattered single blue and single red tiles that are adjacent to the black rectangles bordering the objects seemingly at random. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is, with the exception of changing all of the black rectangle objects to their appropriate selected colors. To determine which color each black rectangle should be changed to, we need to count for each rectangle the surrounding single colored tiles and find the color that has the highest number of tiles. We apply this color selection rule individually for each of the 9 black rectangle objects to determine which color, in this case blue or red, each rectangle should be changed to in the output grid. No other tiles are changed in the output grid besides the color of the black rectangles to their appropriate colors. In this case, in the output grid we should end up with four total blue color changed rectangle objects and five total red color changed rectangle objects."
