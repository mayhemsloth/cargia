    "a": "The input and output grids are the same size. The input grid is a mostly red color background, with two yellow oriented objects present. One of the tiles within this yellow object is a different color, in this case one tile is blue and in the other object one tile is aqua. The output grid looks quite similar to the input grid, with the yellow objects in the same locations, but now has additional blue and aqua tiles throughout the interior and many more aqua and blue tiles filling up the edge. There is one black tile in the corner. The output grid scene can be effectively described as some pulses of the single color tile from each yellow object is shot out from the yellow object source and then colors the edge that it ends up hitting. The corner tile is black because that should be both blue and aqua colors, and because each tile can only be a single color, it is instead just some other color, which is black. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be mostly a background color, probably red. there will be some number of oriented, hat shaped objects that have specific orientation based on their shape. One tile in each of these object will be some other color, an alternative color, other than the background color and the color of that object. In order to construct the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid, we need to effectively add pulsed tiles of this color from the hat shaped oriented object, in the direction that the alternative color tile can be emitted, until this pulsed line of every other tile hits the edge of the output grid, at which point that entire edge is also colored with that same alternative color. In this case, there were two such objects, which happened to be yellow, and two such edges, which were blue and aqua for the alternative colors. If, when following these rules, a tile would need to be changed to two colors at the same time, that color is changed to neither color and is instead changed to black. In this case, that happened in the single corner of the shared edge of the blue and aqua edges in the output grid.",
    "b": "The input grid is a mostly blue color background with two aqua oriented hat shaped objects. One of the tiles within each of the aqua objects is a different color, in this case one tile is red in one object and one tile is green in the other object. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to start from the state of the input grid and then add tiles by pulsing these alternative colored tiles out of the aqua objects until they hit the edge of the output grid, which is the same size as in the input grid. Then we color that entire edge with the alternative color. We note that the pulsed lines are every other tile in a straight line coming out of the oriented hat shaped object. When following these rules if a tile would need to be changed to two colors at the same time, that tile color is changed to neither color and is instead changed to black. In this case, the top left corner would need to be changed to black. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid is a mostly green color background with one blue oriented hat shaped object. One of the tiles within this blue object is a different color, the alternative color, and in this case it is pink. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to start from the input grid state and add tiles to the output grid by pulsing these alternative colored tiles out of the blue objects until they hit the edge of the output grid. At that point, we color the entire edge of the hit edge with the alternative color. The pulsed lines are every other tile in a straight line coming out of the oriented hat-shaped object. When following these rules if a tile would need to be changed to two colors at the same time, then that tile color is changed to neither and is instead changed to black. In this case there will be no black tiles because no tiles would need to be changed to two separate colors. We will have the bottom edge be changed to the pink alternative color instead of the green background. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a mostly yellow color background with three red oriented hat shaped objects. One of the tiles within each red object is a different color, the alternative color, and in this case those colors are blue, gray, and aqua. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to start from the state of the input grid and then add colored tiles to the input grid by pulsing these alternative colored tiles out of the red objects in a straight line until they hit the edge of the output grid. At that point, the entire edge of the contacted edge should be changed to the color of the pulsed line. The pulsed lines are every other tile in a straight line. When following these rules, if a tile would need to be changed to two colors at the same time, then that tile color is changed to neither color and is instead changed to black. In this case, the left edge of the output grid will be blue, the top edge will be aqua, and the right edge will be gray. The top left and top right corners of the output grid will be black colors because they should have been two of the alternative colors, but instead they are changed to black. The output grid is the same size as the input grid."
