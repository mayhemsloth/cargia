    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. This usually means we need to do something to the input grid or select some subsection of the input grid in order to create the output grid. The input grid contains some number of purple tiles all in the top half of the input grid, as well as some yellow tiles, all in the bottom half, on a black color background. Notice that the input grid is six rows tall and five columns wide. Output grid is three rows tall and five columns wide. Thus the output grid is exactly half the number of rows as the input grid. This halving, along with the natural separation of the two colors in the input grid, strongly suggests that there has something to do with a folding or an overlapping mechanism in the input grid in order to identify the locations of the non-background color output grid tiles. Imagine that we treat each top and bottom half of the input grid as different subsections. If we pick up the top half subsection and place it on top of the bottom half subsection, we can imagine where the colors and their tiles overlap. Notice that wherever the purple and yellow tiles coexist in this overlapping mechanism the output grid no longer contains either a yellow or purple tile, but instead a black Color background tile. wherever, in this overlapped imagined grid, There is either a yellow or purple tile that exists. That tile is changed into pink. Wherever there is a black color background tile in both cases, that tile stays black. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. Input grid will have a black color background with exactly two non-background colors in it. Each of these colors will occupy one half of the input grid. In order to construct the output grid, we need to treat these two subsections as their own type of grid and then overlap the two subsections on top of each other. wherever there exists. Exactly one non-background color tile in this overlapped construction, then that tile location is changed to pink. wherever there is either zero or two non-background color tiles in this overlapped construction, then that tile color is changed to a black color background. This is basically a visual representation of the exclusive or operation. The output grid is a type of indicator map that denotes the operation's outcome of the two halves of the input grid.",
    "b": "The input grid, As expected, has a black color background with exactly two colors, purple on the top half and yellow on the bottom half. According to the hypothesis, The output grid must be exactly half as tall as the input grid and the same width. In order to label the output grid with the appropriate pink indicator tiles, we need to treat the input grid as two subsections and overlap them on top of each other. Then we basically do the exclusive or operation on the existence of the purple or yellow tiles. Wherever there exists exactly one non background color tile in this overlapped construction, that tile's location in the output grid is labeled as pink. Whoever there exists Either exactly zero or two non background color tiles in this overlap construction that tile's location in the output grid is labeled as the background color black. Because the output grid shows exactly this, The hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "Input grid again has a black color background with exactly two colors, purple on the top and yellow on the bottom half. According to the hypothesis, the output grid must be exactly half as tall as the input grid with the Same width. In order to construct the output grid with the appropriate pink indicator tiles, we need to treat the input grid as two subsections of top half and bottom half and overlap them on top of each other. Then we basically do the exclusive or operation of the existence of the purple or yellow tiles. Wherever there exists exactly one of these non-background color tiles in this overlap construction, that tile's location in the output grid is labeled as pink. Whenever there exists either exactly zero or two non-background colored tiles in this overlapped instruction, that tile's location in the output grid is labeled as the background color black. Because the output grid shows exactly this, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "The input grid again is a black color background with scattered tiles of exactly two colors. Yellow is on the bottom half, and purple is on the top half, again. According to the hypothesis, the output grid must be exactly half as tall as the input grid and with the same width. In order to construct the output grid with the appropriate pink indicator tiles, we need to treat the input grid as two subsections, The top half and the bottom half. We need to imagine overlap them on top of each other, and then identifying where these non background color tiles overlap or don't. We basically operate the exclusive or operation on this overlapped construction. Because the output grid shows exactly this the hypothesis holds.",
    "e": "At this point, I've seen enough training pairs to be confident in the hypothesis. After a quick inspection of the input grid and the output grid, see that the hypothesis still is supported by this additional training pair.",
    "f": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black color background with scattered tiles of exactly two colors. Purple is on the top and yellow is on the bottom. According to the hypothesis, the output grid should be half as tall as the input grid with the same number of columns. in order to know which tiles in the output grid change to the pink indicator tiles, We need to imagine taking the top half of the input grid and overlapping it onto the bottom half of the input grid. Then we do the exclusive or operation on this overlapped construction. Wherever there exists exactly one purple or yellow tile, that relative location in this overlapped construction turns into a pink tile. Wherever there exists exactly zero or two purple or yellow tiles that relative location is turned into a black background color.",
