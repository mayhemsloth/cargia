    "a": "The input and output grids are drastically different sizes. The input grid is an 8x8 tile grid and the output grid is a 2x2 tile grid. The input grid contains a scattering of yellow, red, and gray tiles that seem to potentially make a complex repeating pattern. Upon further inspection, we see that it seems like the input grid is composed of 4 subsections, the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right sections. The top left and bottom left sections are the same pattern, and then the top right and bottom right sections are a different pattern but the same with respect to each other. The output grid contains these same red, gray, and yellow tiles, in some arrangement. Because the output grid is so much smaller than the input grid, we likely need to follow a selection rule to select a specific small subection of the input grid to copy as the answer in the output grid. In this case we notice that the top left 2x2 corner of the top left 4x4 subsection in the input grid is the exact arrangment of tiles as the output grid. Additionally, the bottom right 2x2 corner of the top right 4x4 subsection of the input grid contains this exact arrangement of tiles as the output grid. Perhaps this commonality is the selection rule? Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some number of colored tiles that establish two separate repeating patterns in differnet subsections of the input grid. In order to construct the output grid, we need to first identify and select the largest section of common tiles across these two patterned subsections. Note that this is a weak hypothesis and there very well may be a different explanation for the selection rule.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are again drastically different sizes. The input grid is a 6x6 tile grid and the output grid is a 2x2 tile grid. The input grid contains a scattering of yellow, green, pink and black tiles, in some type of pattern. We notice now that the input grid is different integer multiple of 2x2 in this case than in the previous training pair. Perhaps the selection rule for the output grid is simply that there is some repeating cell that creates the input grid by tiling it in some fashion, and we need to identify and select that repeating cell as the output grid. We notice as well that the top left 2x2 section of the input grid is the output grid, and in the previous pair that was also the case. In this case, the input grid can be constructed by copying and also rotating this 2x2 grid cell of yellow, green, pink and black. Thus the amended hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some multicolor tiles that is ultimately created by a single cell of tiles that is copied and repeatedly rotated and placed next to each other to make a complex repeating pattern. In order to construct the output grid, we need to identify single cell of tiles that is copied and repeatedly rotated, and select that exact cell as the output grid. In each case so far, they have been 2x2 squares, but they may be larger squares. The exact orientation has been established by the top left corner of the input grid.",
    "c": "The input grid is a 6 column wide and 12 row tall rectangle composed of green, yellow, red, and blue tiles in some complex repeating pattern. According to the amended hypothess, in order to construct the output grid, we need to first identify the repeating cell of multicolored tiles that is ultimately creating the entire input grid by copying it and rotating the cell across the input grid. Because the input grid again has even sized dimensions, we expect the cell to be a 2x2 square, however each cell is also cleanly divisible by 3, so it could also be a 3x3 square. However we see that a single cell of green, red, blue and yellow tiles can be rotated to create the input grid, and thus we select the orientation as established by the top left corner of the input grid. Thus the output grid should be this 2x2 square cell, which is a green tile in the top left, a red tile in the top right, a blue tile in the bottom left, and a yellow tile in the bottom left of the 2x2 square sized output grid. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the amended hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is 8 columns wide and 4 rows tall, contain purple red and pink tiles in a complex repeating pattern. According to the amended hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to first identify the repeating cell of multicolored tiles that is ultimately creating the entire input grid by copying this cell and rotating it across the input grid. Because the input grid again has even sized dimensions, we expect the cell to be a 2x2 square. We see in the input grid that the top left 2x2 section of the input grid could be a cell that is used to copy and rotate to make the rest of the input grid. We take this orientation to be the exact orientation expect in the output grid, and thus the output grid should be a 2x2 grid with purple tiles in the top left and bottom right corners, and then a pink tile in the top right corner and a red tile in the bottom left corner."
