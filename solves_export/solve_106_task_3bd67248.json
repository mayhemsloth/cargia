The output grid has those same gray tiles but with some additional red and yellow tiles. There isn't too much happening in the transformation so it's hard to form a hypothesis with just this pair. However if we had to make a hypothesis, it might be something like the following. The input grid will be of some size, with the output grid the same size as the input grid. It will contain, on a black color background, a gray tile line on one of the edges, in this case the left edge. In order to construct the output grid, we must fill one of the adjacent edges of this gray tile edge, in this case the bottom edge, with yellow tiles. We must also add a red diagonal line that starts in the black background corner created by the gray and yellow lines. This is not a strong hypothesis and additional training pair examples would help us to strength or amend this hypothesis.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are the same sizes, but this time much larger than the previous training pair. The input grid has a black color background with a vertical pink line along the entire left edge. According to the hypothesis, this should have been gray. Since it is not, we need to amend the hypothesis. Looking at the output grid, we see a yellow horizontal line along the bottom edge of the output grid, and also a red diagonal line that starts in the corner created by the pink and yellow lines and ends in the opposite corner of the output grid. The new hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be of some size, with a black color background and a vertical line of some non-background color on the left edge. In order to construct the output grid of the same size as the input grid, we copy over the input grid as is and also add two additional lines. The first line is a horizontal yellow line along the bottom edge of the output grid. The second line is a diagonal red line that start on the black background tile corner made by the two edge lines. It extends all the way to the opposite corner of the output grid.",
    "c": "The input grid contains a black color background with an aqua vertical line along the left edge. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we copy over the input grid as is but added two lines to the output grid. The first line we add is a horizontal yellow line along the entire bottom edge. The second line we add is a diagonal red line that start in the black color background corner tile that is created by the two edge lines, and then extends to the opposite corner of the output grid. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is of some size and contains a black color background with a vertical line on the left edge, in this case a green line. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid we must copy over the input grid as is with the exception of the addition of two lines in the output grid. The first line is a horizontal yellow line along the entire bottom edge of the output grid. The second line is a red diagonal line which starts in the corner background color tile that is formed by the green and yellow lines, not the actual intersection of the lines, but the first background color tile of the interior corner. This red diagonal line then extends the entire grid to the opposite corner of the output grid."
