    "a": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid contains a black color background with an aqua color object of a peculiar shape. The aqua object looks like it's a slanted rectangle. The output grid also has this black color background with the aqua object. Looking closely, we can see that the aqua object top half has moved to the right by one column. We imagine these aqua tiles as being solid objects, then we can describe this movement from the input grid to the output grid as all aqua tiles that are able to move to the right without hitting either the output grid edge or another aqua tile gets moved to the right. This is essentially a translation operation with some natural physical real-world restrictions applied on the aqua tiles. Thus the hypothesis is the following: input grid will contain a black color background with some non-background color object. In order to construct the output grid, we need to move this object to the right by one column. However this movement of the tiles of the object has some restrictions: Any tile that would hit the edge of the frame of the output grid stay there and don't move past the frame of the output grid. Additionally, the tiles act similarly to solid objects, and prohibit the movement of other tiles that would otherwise need to move to the right.",
    "b": "The input grid has a black color background and two different objects that look like slanted rectangles, one pink and one red. According to the hypothesis, we need to translate the entire objects to the right by one column, some restrictions on this movement. As it turns out, the output grid does not show this, because we notice that the bottom right parts of the two objects stay in the same location. Thus, the hypothesis is slightly wrong. Looking back at the first pair, we attributed the stopping of the bottom right part of the aqua object to interacting with the edge of frame of the output grid. Instead, it seems like in this new train pair, the bottom right L shaped block of the slanted rectangles simply do not move at all, and the rest of the object moves to the right one column. Thus, a slightly amended hypothesis is the following. Input grid will contain some number of slanted rectangle-like objects, of non-background color colors. These objects should contain an L-shaped block in the bottom right of it. In order to construct the output grid, we need to move all the other tiles by exactly one column to the right, keeping this L shaped block in the exact location in the output grid as it it in the input grid. The shape will slightly change because some portion of the object is being moved relative to itself.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black color background with a yellow slanted rectangle object. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify the L-plot in the bottom right of the slanted rectangle, and keep those tiles located in the same spot in the output grid. All the other tiles that make up this yellow object need to be moved to the right by one column, exposing the blback background tiles behind it. The rest of the input grid otherwise stays the same, with the exception of the relative movement of the specific tiles in the yellow object."
