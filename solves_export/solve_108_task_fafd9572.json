    "a": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. Input grid has a black color background and a variety of objects that have the same shapes but different colors. In this case, three of the objects are entirely blue, and one object is multicolored, comprising of a single green tile, a single red tile, and a single yellow tile. We notice in the output upgrade that the multicolored object has persisted and remains unchanged, the other blue objects are now a new color, each one being composed of a single color. In this case, green, red, and yellow. How do we know which colors to put where? Well, we notice in the output grid that the relative location of the single color tiles in the original multi-color object shape corresponds to the relative location of the single color objects. For example, the green tile in the multi-color object is located in the bottom left of the object. The all-green version of the shape is also located in the bottom left of the three blue objects. We notice also that the relative locations of the shapes themselves matches the shape of each individual object. The shapes of the objects has three tiles and also there are three blue objects, each containing that shape. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will have a black color background with some number of objects, all of which are the same shape. Almost all of the objects will be solidly colored with some non-background color, in this case blue, and then one object will be a mapping object that is responsible for telling us how we should assign colors to the solid colored objects in the output grid. the relative locations of the colored tiles in the mapping object informs us of the locations of the solid color objects should turn into. Thus is a somewhat complex hypothesis so we will want to confirm it with more training examples and potentially with different shapes and colors.",
    "b": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid contains a black color background with some number of objects, all of which are the same shape. According to the hypothesis, all of the objects except for one should be a solid non-background color, which in this case is again blue. One of the objects should have some number of unique tile colors, and this object is the mapping object. In this case, the mapping object has only green and red tiles. In order to construct the output grid, we copy over this mapping object and the locations of all of the blue objects, but we need to change the colors of all the solid blue color object. The mapping object tells us which color to make the blue objects. Note, again, that, according to the hypothesis,  the shapes themselves are located in the output grid to reflect the shape of each individal shape. This allows us to use the mapping object's individual tile colors to apply to the different solid blue object. For example, in this case, the top left and bottom right tiles in the mapping object is colored red. Thus, the top left and bottom right blue solid objects should be colored red in the output grid. The rest of the object should be colored green because the rest of the tiles in the mapping object are green. Because this is what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black color background with a number of different objects, all of the same shape. According to the hypothesis all of the objects except for one should be a solid non-background color, in this case blue. The object that is not all this solid color is the mapping object. In this case, the mapping object is located in the top left corner and is made up with red, orange, yellow, and green tiles. In order to disrupt the output grid, we copy over this mapping object in the locations of all of the blue objects. But we need to change the colors of all of the solid blue color objects. The mapping objects tells us which color to make the blue objects. According to the hypothesis, the blue objects themselves should be oriented and located in such a way that it represents the object shape. In this way, the mapping object can tell us via the relative locations of the blue objects which ones should be colored what. For example, the top blue object will be colored red and the center one will be colored orange. two objects next to the orange will be colored yellow and the bottom most objects will be colored green, because these are the relative locations of the tiles in the mapping objects."
