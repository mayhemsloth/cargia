  "thoughts": {
    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. Specifically, the output grid is three times larger than the input grid on both edges. The input grid is a 3x3 square, and the output grid is a 9x9 square. Because of these relationships. We're suspecting the hypothesis has something to do with expanding the grid itself and understanding how we fill in the now larger output grid. We notice that the input grid has three yellow tiles, three orange tiles, and three aqua tiles. If we look at the output grid as sections of 3x3 squares, we also notice that there are 3 yellow sections, 3 orange sections, and 3 aqua sections. Additionally, these corresponding colored sections are located in the same relative place in the output grid as they are in the input grid. Thus here's our starting hypothesis. The input grid will be of some size of a variety of colors. the output grid will be three times that size on both edges. output grid's colors will be three by three squares corresponding to the similar locations of the colors of the tiles in the input grid. The idea is that we are simply expanding the input grid tiles themselves to be a 3x3 each instead of 1x1 each, but keepign the relative locations and colors the same.",
    "b": "The input grid and output grids are the same size. This is very different than the first pair, and therefore our hypothesis is likely incorrect. If our hypothesis was correct, then we would expect the output grid to be three times larger on both edges. However, it is not. So my new hypothesis is That perhaps the number of expansions that we made for the output grid itself connects to the number of colors that exist in the input grid. For example, in this pairs input grid, we have one single color, aqua, shown.  The output grid is thus expanded by 1x. Meaning that it is not expanded at all, therefore the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid. This hypothesis also holds for the previous pair. The input grid of the previous pair contains three distinct colors, yellow, orange, and aqua. The number three there dictates the amount by which we expand the input grid to make the output grid. We will likely need another pair to be certain of this rule.",
    "c": "This new pair is also a 3x3 input grid of a single color. The output grid is also a 3x3 grid of the same color. Therefore, our new hypothesis holds. Because the input grid has a single color, in this case green, the output grid is expanded by 1x. which is the same as saying that the output grid doesn't expand at all. and therefore the output grid is exactly the same as the input grid. If we have some pair that has two colors or three colors or four colors, then we can confirm this hypothesis even further.",
    "d": "The input grid is a 3x3 square, and the output grid Is a 12 by 12 square Notice that the input grid has four distinct colors. yellow, red, aqua, and gray. According to hypothesis, we expect the output grid to be expanded by 4x. where each tile in the input grid, it becomes a four by four square of the same color. Indeed, that hypothesis is true for this pair. The top yellow tile in the input grid is expanded to become a 4x4 square in the output grid. Likewise, all other tiles in the input grid are expanded to become four by four squares in the output grid located in the same relative location to each other. The number by which each tile is expanded is dictated by the number of distinct colors that exist in the entirety of the input grid, in this case, four.",
    "e": "The input grid of 3x3 has two distinct colors, red and yellow. The output grid is a 6x6 grid. This supports our hypothesis of that the amount that the input tiles get expanded to is determined by the number of distinct colors in the input grid. In this pair, Each colored tile in the input grid is expanded to a 2x2 square located in the same relative location in the output grid as the input grid. we expand it into a two by two square because there are two distinct colors. Thus the hypothesis holds. We now have examples of one, two, three, and four distinct colors in the input grid. This strongly supports our current hypothesis.",
    "f": "Again we have an input grid that is three by three tiles with two distinct colors, pink and blue, in the input grid. The output grid is a six by six grid which means that the input grid has been expanded per tile by 2x on each edge. The output grid is again colored in such a way that it is the same colors as the input grid in the same relative locations, but expanded by 2x. the hypothesis thus holds.",
    "g": "Input grid is a 3x3 square with two distinct colors, pink and green. According to the hypothesis, the output grid should be a 6 by 6 grid, after expanding by two on each side, with tiles colored pink and green. Single tiles in the input grid thus become two by two subsections in the output grid and are arranged in the same relative locations as they are in the input grid. This is exactly what we find in the output grid, and thus the hypothesis still holds.",
    "h": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a 3x3 square with five distinct colors, orange, blue, green, aqua, and pink. According to the hypothesis, we must expand the input grid by 5x on both sides. We choose five because there are five distinct colors in the input grid. every tile in the input grid, the output grid must contain a 5x5 square subsection of the similar color located in the relative location as the input grid. For example, The top left corner of the input grid is an orange tile. The top left subsection of the output grid should thus be a 5 by 5 orange square. Top middle of the input grid is a blue tile, thus the top middle of the output grid should be a 5x5 subsection square. The output grid will be a 15x15 grid in total, but with 9 total subsections of which each are 5 by 5 squares."
