    "a": "Input and output grids are different sizes. We notice immediately that some part of the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid, And further, that the other part of the output grid is also the same size, 3x3 in this case, as the input grid. As the input and output grid are integer multiples of each other, transformation rule is likely something to do with copying the input grid as is and then also doing some type of transformation to it and appending that transformed version to the right of it. Let's inspect the contents of the output grid more closely. The left half of the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid. The right half of the output grid looks to be some type of mirrored inverse of the input grid. The background color is black in the input grid, and the object is red. However in the right side of the output grid, there is a mirrored version of the red object shape in the color of the black background. This is the main thing that led me to the following hypothesis. The input grid will contain a background color and some colored object. output grid is an exact copy of the input grid but with an additional grid to the right of that copy. To produce this right half section correctly in the output grid, we need to mirror the input grid vertically, so that the left side columns becomes the right side columns and right side columns become the left side columns. Any center coloumn will stay the same. After we have mirrored the input grid along the vertical axis, Then we change what used to be the background color into aqua and what used to be the red color into the background color. This is what I mean by a type of inverse, or inverting the colors.",
    "b": "The input grid is again a black colored background with some red tiles. According to the hypothesis, We would need to copy this input grid onto the left side of the output grid and then mirror it and invert the colors to produce the right-hand section of the output grid. However, we see in this pair's output grid that the exact copy of the input grid is instead on the right-hand side of the output grid, so our previous hypothesis can not be correct. There must be some type of feature in the structure of the input grid itself that dictates how side the original copy does to in the output grid. Looking at the input grid again more closely, we notice that the entire left column in the first pair's input grid is the background color. We notice in this pair's input grid, the entire right column is background color. Perhaps this is the indicator that tells us which side the input grid copy needs to be placed in the output grid. Thus the amended hypothesis is the following: Input grid will contain the background color black and some amount of tiles of red. Additionally, either the right hand side column or the left most column will be entirely the background color. After we identify which column that is, we start to construct the output grid by taking an exact copy of the input grid and placing it into either the right section of the output grid, when the rightmost column is fully background color, or the left section of the output grid, when the leftmost column is fully background color. The other half of the output grid is constructed by taking a vertical mirror copy of the input grid and then inverting the colors by making the red colors into black background color and the black background color into aqua. This means the output grid will always be two times wider then the input grid and the same number of rows high.",
    "c": "The input grid is a 3x3 square with a black background and red shape in it, And the output grid is double-wide that input grid in the same height. According to the hypothesis, the input grid should have either the right or left most columns entirely the background color, which it does. In this case, the right side column is entirely the background color. According to the hypothesis, that means we start constructing the output grid by placing an exact copy of the input grid into the right half of the output grid. to construct the left half of the output grid, we need to mirror the input grid along the vertical axis, and then invert the colors, Making the red colors into the background color and then making the background color into aqua. And because this is exactly what we see in the output grid our hypothesis holds",
    "d": "Input grid is again a background color of black with some red tiles in it. According to the hypothesis, there should be either the left or right most column entirely the background color. In this case, the leftmost column is the background color black. According to the hypothesis, we start to construct the output grid by copying the input grid as is to the left half side of the output grid. The right half side of the output grid is mirrored version of the input grid, and then with the colors inverted. wherever there was red in the mirror version, there should now be background color, and wherever there was background color there should now be aqua. Because the output grid shows exactly what we expect here, the hypothesis holds.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid has a background color of black with some red tiles in it. According to the hypothesis, either the right or left edge of the input grid should contain an entirely background color. Indeed in this case the left most column is the background color of black. This means we can start to construct the output grid by copying the input grid exactly as it is and placing it on the left half of the output grid. The right half of the output grid is constructed by mirroring along the vertical axis the input grid, and then doing a color inversion on it. That color inversion means that wherever there were red tiles in the mirrored version there are now black background color, and wherever there were black background tiles, there will now be aqua tiles. This section is the right half of the output grid, and thus the output grid will be twice as wide as the input grid and the same height."
