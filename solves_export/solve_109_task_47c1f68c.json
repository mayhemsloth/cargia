    "a": "The input and output grids are nearly the same size but are not the same sizes. Specifically, the input grid is a 9x9 square, and the output grid is a 8x8 tile square. The input grid contains a black color background with a single green object in the top left corner and a vertical and horizontal aqua line that splits the input grid into four subsections, specifically 4 4x4 square subsections. We note that four 4x4 square subsections can be combined to make a single 8x8 square, which is likely how the output grid has the number of tiles that it has. Looking at the output grid, we see that the shape of the object that is in the top left subsection of the input grid is also in the top left section of the output grid, but has been turned to aqua. Additional aqua objects have appeared in the other corners of the output grid, and they look to be mirror version of the original shape, all colored the same color as the vertical and horizontal lines. It seems like the lines are acting as mirrors in the input grid and we need to do mirror copy operations on the subsection with the object in it to construct the output grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. Input grid will be of some size and contain horizontal and vertical lines in the center, splitting it into four equally sized subsection. The input grid will likely have a black color background and some non-background color object in one of the subsections. In order to construct this output grid, we use the horizontal and vertical lines as essentially a mirror that than goes away in the output grid. So we populate the different subsections with the appropriates mirrored copies of the starting object, now in the same color as the lines themselves, and push together all the subsection such that there a single row and column now missing in the output grid compared to the input grid. Note that the object to be mirrored does not need to be located in the corner or even the top left subection. Wherever it is located, it should be appropriately mirror copied over to the other subsections.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are, again, different sizes. In this case, the input grid is an 11x11 tile square, and the output grid is a 10x10 tile square. The input grid has a black color background and a horizontal and vertical red line that splits the input grid into four different subsections. In one of the subsections, in this case the top left, there is a blue object. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy this blue object over into the other subsections by mirroring it across the horizontal and vertical lines. When we do this, we also need to change the color fo the object to the color of the lines themselves, which in this case is red. The newer lines are gone in the output grid, which is why we lose a row and column in the output grid. Because the original object has been changed to red, and the mirrored objects are all red and in the appropriate locations after being mirrored right, down, or right and down, the hypthesis holds.",
    "c": "Input Grid and Output Grid are different sizes as expected. The input grid is a 7x7 square, and the output grid is a 6x6 tile square. According to the hypothesis, the input grid should contain vertical and horizontal lines down the center that divide the input grid into four equal-sized subsections, in this case three by three square subsections and yellow lines. The input grid has a black color background and one of these subsections has a non-background color object in it, in this case red. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy this red object over to the other subsections while also mirroring it across the mirror lines. Additionally, these objects need to be changed to the color of the lines, which in this case is yellow. Note that the mirror lines themselves are removed from the output grid, and the subsections act as if they are smooshed together next to eachother, so it can look like the objects in the four subsections are now touching. In this case, due to the shape of the original object, it looks like that. This is still consistent with the hypothesis. Because the output grid looks exactly as expected, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a 13x13 tile square, and thus the output grid should be a 12x12 tile square. According to the hypothesis, the input grid should contain a black color background with a vertical and horizontal line in the center that divides the input grid into four equal sized subsections. In one of these top subsections, In this case, the top left, there is a non-background color object. That object is Aqua in this case. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over this object into the other subsections by mirroring it into the appropriate locations. When we do this copy and mirroring operation, the color of the object changes from the original color into the color of the mirror lines, which in this case is green. Note that the mirror lines themselves are not present in the output grid, and it's as if the different subsections are smooshed together next to each other. We need to make sure that the mirror operation is done correctly and the tiles are located in the correct relative location in the differnt subsections after being mirrored right, down, or right and down."
