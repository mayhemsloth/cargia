    "a": "Input and output grids are very different sizes. In this case the input grid is a 3x3 square and the output grid is a 9x9 square. We notice immediately that the output grid can be described as a 3x3 grid of subsections, each of which are 3x3 tile squares, which happens to be the same size as the input grid. This is probably important to the transformation rule, as it likely means we will need to figure out where to place the 3x3 input grid into the output grid. The input grid contains a black color background and some red and blue tiles. The output grid contains mainly a black color background, but with the 3x3  input grid copied into exactly two of the square subsections in the output grid. In this case, the copies are located in the top right and bottom left corners of the output grid's subsections. Why are they located there? We notice that within the input grid, the two tiles that are colored with red are located in the top right and bottom left corners of the 3x3 input grid. So this is likely an indicator tile color to tell us how to construct the output grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. Input grid will be likely be a 3x3 square with some number of black color background tiles and some number of red tiles in it, along with potentially other colors to establish the input grid pattern. In order to construct the output grid, which will be exactly 9x9 tiles large, we need to identify the red tile locations within the input grid. These act as indicator tile locations to place exact copies of the input grid into the output grid's subsections. We need to copy over the entirety of the input grid pattern. The rest of the subsections that are not selected to be copied over onto are instead filled with the background color, which is black in this case.",
    "b": "Input grid is again a 3x3 square with black background tiles and some number of blue tiles and red tiles. Output grid is again a nine by nine tile square with a lot of black background tiles and some number of copies of the input grid pattern. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify the relative locations of the red tiles in the input grid. These red tiles are indicator tiles on where to copy over the input grid pattern onto the output grid's subsections. In this case, there is exactly one red indicator tile, which is located in the left column, middle row. This means the input grid pattern will be copied over exactly once, into the left column and middle row subsection of the 3x3 subsection array in the output grid. The rest of the output grid's subsections are filled with black color background. Because this is what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid is again a 3x3 square with black background colored tiles and some number of blue and red indicator tiles. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify the relative location of all the red indicator tiles. The output grid will be a nine by nine square, made up of 9 total subsections in a 3x3 array. Each 3x3 subsection needs to contain either the background color or an exact copy of the pattern established in the input grid. In this case there are 4 total red indicator tiles, so there will be four total copies of the input grid into the output grid. Specifically, they will be in the top left, top right, bottom left corners, as well as the center of the 3x3 subsection array. Because this is what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid is a three by three square with black color background tiles and some number of blue tiles, and red indicator tiles. In this case, there are four red indicator tiles. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify the relative location of all of the red indicator tiles. The output grid will be a 9x9 square made up of nine total subsections in a three by three array. Each 3x3 subsection will be either the background color black or an exact copy of the pattern established in the input grid. In this case there are four total red indicator tiles and their relative locations will determine the relative locations of the subsections of the output grid that are exact copies of the input grid. Any other subsection in the output grid is black color background."
