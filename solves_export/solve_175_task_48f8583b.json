    "a": "The input and output grids are drastically different sizes. The input grid is a 3x3 tile square and the output grid is a 9x9 tile square. The input grid contains a variety of colored tiles including green, red, orange and gray. The output grid contains an exact copy of the 3x3 input grid, but embedded in a much larger 9x9 tile grid of all black tiles. Due to the size difference of the input and output grid and the relative integer multiples of the sizes between the input and output grid, very likely we need to treat the output grid as a supergrid of 3x3 subsections. Then, the input grid has some indicator tiles that tell us which subsections of teh output grid's supergrid to make a copy of the input grid, and which subsections should simply be black tiles. We don't have that much information, but likely the green tile is the indicator tile, because that tile is in the top left and the copy of the input grid is also located in the top left subsection of the output grid. Additionally, that's the only green tile in the input grid, and that's the only subsection with a copy of the input grid. However we will want additional training pairs to be sure of a hypothesis.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are drastically different sizes again. The input grid is a 3x3 tile square and the output grid is a 9x9 tile square. The input grid contains a variety of colored tiles including aqua, gray, and purple. The output grid contains two exact copies of the 3x3 input grid, but embedded in a much larger 9x9 tile grid of all black tiles. Because of the integer multiple of the output grid and input grid sizes, we assumed that there would be some type of indicator tile to tell us where exactly to put the copies of the input grid in the output grid. We had thought it was perhaps the green color tile locations. However we see in this training pair that there is no green color in the input grid, and because of that the indicator tile can't be fixed to a single color like green. The indicator tile color is likely itself derived from the input grid by some rule. For example, in the previous training pair, the green color was the color with the fewest tiles present in the input grid, only containing one in the input grid. In this training pair, the purple tiles are the fewest number of tiles in the input grid, containing only two purple tiles. The output grid just so happens to have a copy of the input grid located in the supergrid's two subsections of 3x3 tiles in the relative locations as the two purple tiles in the input grid. This is likely pointing us to the indicator tile color rule that says we need to select the color with the fewest tiles in the input grid to be the indicator tiles. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain likely a 3x3 tile square composed of some number of different colors. In order to construct the output grid, we need to first select the color in the input grid with the fewest number of total tiles as our indicator tile color. The output grid will be a 9x9 tile square that can be described as a supergrid of 3x3 subsections, with each subsection being a 3x3 tile square. The indicator tile color will tell us which of these subsections in the supergrid should be changed to an exact copy of the input grid instead of being entirely black color tiles. The subsection in the same relative location of all tiles of the indicator color present in the input grid should contain an exact copy of the input grid. For example, if the bottom right corner of the input grid contains an indicator color tile, then the bottom right subsection of the supergrid in the output grid should also contain a copy of the input grid.",
    "c": "As expected, the input grid is a 3x3 tile square. The input grid contains two different colors of tiles, blue and orange. Specifically, the input grid contains three blue tiles and six orange tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we first need to select the appropriate indicator tile color, which is done by identifying the color with the fewest total tiles in the input grid. In this case, blue will be our indicator tile color. The output grid will be a 9x9 tile square that can be described as a supergrid of 3x3 subsections. with each subsection being a 3x3 tile square. The indicator tile color will tell us which of these subsections in the supergrid should be changed to an exact copy of the input grid instead of being entirely black color tiles. The subsection in the same relative location of all the tiles of the indicator color present in the input grid should contain an exact copy of the input grid. In this case, there should be three subsections in the output grid that contain a copy of the input grid because there are three blue tiles in the input grid and blue is the indicator color. The relative locations of these subsections is dictated by the relative locations of the blue tiles in the input grid. Because the output grid contains exactly what we expect, the hypothesis holds.",

In this case, there will be exactly one subsection that contains a copy of the input grid, the subsection in the top right corner, because there is only one pink color tile in the input grid, which is in the top right corner, and pink is the indicator color. Therefore there will also be 8 subsections, all the rest of the subsections, that contain only black color tiles. Because the output grid contains exactly what we expect it to, the hypothesis holds.",

Because the output grid contains exactly what we expect it to, the hypothesis holds and we are now very confident in the hypothesis.",
    "g": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a 3x3 tile square and contains two different colors of tiles, purple and orange. Specifically, the input grid contains four orange tiles and five purple tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we first need to select the appropriate indicator tile color, which is done by identifying the color with the fewest total tiles in the input grid. In this case, orange is the indicator tile color. The output grid will need to be a 9x9 tile square that can be described as a supergrid of 3x3 subsections with each subsection being a 3x3 tile square. The indicator tile color will tell us which of these subsections in the supergrid should be changed to an exact copy of the 3x3 input grid instead of being entirely black colored tiles. In the output grid, each subsection in the same relative location of all of the tiles of the indicator color in the input grid should contain an exact copy of the input grid. In this case, there will be four subsections that contain a copy of the input grid because there are four orange color tiles in the input grid, and orange is the selected indicator tile color. This also means there will be 5 total subsections of 3x3 tiles contianing all black tiles."
