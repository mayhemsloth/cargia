The input grid contains a variety of different blue shaped objects on a black background, In this case, we have a 2 by 2 square, a plus sign, an L shaped object, and two 3x3 bounding boxes. The output grid contains some of these objects in their exact locations and colors, but some of them have been replaced by a different object and a different color. Specifically, the two 3x3 bounding boxes with the holes in them have been replaced by a red plus sign. We note that the plus sign is another shape that was present in the input grid and is still present, unchanged, in the output grid. It seems like the hypothesis should be that we need to identify some objects in the input grid to transform into a different object in the input grid. However, I'm not confident about the selection rule that determines which of these objects we need to copy and which of these we are selected to change. I feel like we need an additional training pair to help us solidify a hypothesis.",
    "b": "Input and output grids are again the same sizes. Input grid again contains a variety of different blue shaped objects and a black color background We see two 3x3 bounding boxes and two blue plus signs. We also have a 1x2 object. Output grid has again transformed all of the 3x3 bounding boxes into red plus signs in the same relative location, and has kept all the other blue objects the same. Perhaps the hypothesis is simpler than I originally thought. The hypothesis is the following. The input grid will have a black colored background and a variety of blue shaped objects. In order to construct the output grid, we need to identify all of the three by three bounding boxes. That is three by three squares with the center tile missing, and replace those objects with red plus signs, with their centers located in the same location as the bounding box center. The rest of the input grid is copied over exactly as is into the output grid.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a variety of blue shaped objects on a black color background. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify all the 3x3 bounding boxes in the input grid, which are 3x3 squares with the the center missing, and then in the output grid replace those objects with red plus signs, located in the same relative location as the bounding boxes. The rest of the input grid is copied over as is to the output grid."
