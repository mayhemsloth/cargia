    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. In the input grid, we have a black color background and a yellow bounding box, With some gray and blue tiles inside of the yellow bounding box. We notice at the top, above the top edge of the yellow bounding box, also there seem to be five pairs of what may be indicator tiles. From the left to the right we have blue, red, green, yellow, and gray. The output grid has a similar structure to the input grid, but not exactly the same. It seems like the indicator tiles are still there at the top, as well as the bounding box. However, the bounding box has changed colors from yellow to gray. The internal of the bounding box has significantly changed, with the blue tiles no longer present and there being a new rectangular interior gray bounding box. Honestly, I don't have a solid hypothesis right now. I think that the top row has to be some type of indicator tiles telling us what to do to transform the input into the output. The shapes and structure of the interior blue and gray tiles are not immediately giving me any hints as to how you would arrive at needing to draw a gray interior rectangle as it is in the output grid. I hope additional pairs will give more information to form a solid hypothesis.",
    "b": "We again have an input grid and output grid that are the same sizes and have a similarish structure to them. The input grid contains a red bounding box here, with the same type of pairs of indicator tiles at the top. From left to right, they're in the same order, blue, red, green, yellow, and gray. We notice the interior of the red bounding box has a black background with seemingly scattered random tiles of green and yellow. The output grid again has the same compounding box, which has been turned into green this time. the interior has yet another bounding box, which in this case is also green. I think I have a hypothesis now. Let's first deal with the exterior bounding box. In the first pair, we saw a yellow bounding box, which turned into a gray bounding box. The yellow and gray colors are directly next to each other in the indicator tile row. So perhaps the rule for the exterior bounding box is that we need to change the color of whatever the bounding box is, to the color to the right in the indicator row. In the first pair, that would be yellow to gray. In this pair, that would be red to green. Note that indeed the output grid contains an exterior bounding box of color green. So that seems like a solid hypothesis. Now, separately, we need to deal with the interior part of the bounding box. How do we know which color to choose and where to place the bounding box? Well, we notice in both pairs, the bounding box that ends up getting drawn is of the color that has more tiles. In the first pair, there were more gray tiles than blue tiles. Therefore, the gray tiles win out and the blue tiles disappear. In this pear example, we see that there are way more green tiles in the interior than yellow tiles. Therefore, the green tiles win out and the yellow tiles disappear. So now we have a hypothesis of how to select the color of the interior bounding box. How do we determine where to draw the interior bounding box? My hypothesis currently is that we need to draw the interior bounding box, with the selected color, such that it would include all tiles that are of that same color. In this case, we need to draw a very large interior bounding box because the greens are spread out so much. This is a very specific multi-step hypothesis, and I hope we get another train example pair to solidify this hypothesis.",
    "c": "Input grid and output grid are again the same sizes. The input grid contains an exterior bounding box that is almost the entire input grid, with the exception of the top row, which is again indicator tiles. The interior of the bounding box is black color background with some randomly scattered tiles. According to the hypothesis, the exterior input grid color should be changed from blue to red, because in the indicator row the red is to the right of the blue. However, in this output pair, it is not. The exterior bounding box has been changed to yellow. So I think that the hypothesis for that part is wrong, And instead, it is probably even simpler than this. The new hypothesis is that there is an exterior bounding box of some color In the interior of this bounding box, there are scattered tiles. We must identify the color of the tiles that has the most number of scattered tiles in the interior, that are non-background color. In this case, there are five yellow tiles and three red tiles, Therefore, we are selecting yellow. This selection dictates what the external bounding box color should be in the output grid, not the relative location of colors in the indicator tile rows. This is consistent with all the pairs shown so far, And thus is our hypothesis now. the rest of the hypothesis still holds. Because yellow has the most number of tiles in the interior, We ignore all the rest of the colored non-background color tiles, In this case, the three red tiles. The next step is to draw an interior bounding box of the yellow color. the placement and shape of this interior bounding box must be such that it would overlap entirely all of the yellow scattered tiles in the interior of the input grid. This is waht we see in the output grid of this example pair, and thus the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. the input grid has a bounding box that contains almost the entire input grid, with the exception of the indicator row at the top. In this input grid, we have a red bounding box and a black color background with some scattered tiles in the interior. There are only three such non-background color tiles in the interior. There are two yellow tiles and one blue tile According to the hypothesis, we need to identify the color with the most number of tiles, which in this case is yellow. The output grid should be a copy of the input grid but with the following changes. The exterior bounding box is changed to the selected color yellow. Then we need to construct an interior bounding box according to the hypothesis. All the other non-selected colored tiles of the interior go away, which in this case is just one blue tile. Next, we need to create a yellow bounding box that would overlap all of the yellow tiles in the input grid. In this case, because the yellow tiles are so close to each other only separated by a single diagonal, The bounding box needs to only be a two by two square, positioned in the output grid such that it would overlap the locations of the input grid's two yellow tiles. The background tiles stay the color of black.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a bounding box of gray with a black color background in the interior of it. Additionally, there are scattered colored tiles in the interior. In this case, there are three red tiles and two blue tiles. There's also the indicator row at the top of the input grid. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify the color with the most number of tiles on the interior of the bounding box, which in this case is red. The exterior bounding box is thus changed to the color red in the output grid. Additionally, we need to create the interior bounding box. Because the selected color is red, we ignore blue tiles entirely. Because the selected color is red, we have to identify and construct the bounding box that would overlap all of the red tiles that appear in the input grid, and place it in a location such that it would overlap all of the red tiles, and not any larger than that. All the red tiles in the interior of the input color disappear as well, and what remains in the output grid is the indicator tile row at the top, the exterior bounding box, the interior bounding box palced in the correct location, and the black color background."
