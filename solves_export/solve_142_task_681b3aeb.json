    "a": "The input and output grids are drastically different sizes. The input grid is a large grid of mostly a black color background with two separate objects, one pink and one yellow. The output grid has no black color background and instead only pink and yellow tiles, and is a 3x3 square tile size. We notice that the output grid contains the same yellow and pink object shapes that are located in the input grid, just rearranged to complete a single 3x3 square. Because the input and output grids are such different sizes, it seems like the input grid will contain some number of objects that can be pieced together to form a specific rectangle or square shape, which is then the entirety of the output grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a background color, probably black, and some number of different colored objects. These objects can be moved or translated without rotation to complete or fill into each other, similar to puzzle pieces, and then the shape made by that rearrangement will be the size of the output grid. The output grid will simply contain that exact rearranged shape. Note that it could always be a 3x3 square, or perhaps it could be different sized shapes, we will need more training pairs to strengthen this part of the hypothesis.",
    "b": "As expected, the input and output grids are again drastically different sizes. Input grid is a large grid of mostly black color background with two separate objects, in this case one green and one orange. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to rearrange these objects via translation, and without rotation, such that they fill into each other to create a single 3x3 square. In this case, we notice that the green L-shaped object fits nicely into the left side of the orange object, forming a 3x3 square as expected. The output grid is exactly this 3x3 square grid, with no black tiles. The two objects act as puzzle pieces that fill into each other to totally fill a 3x3 square. Because the output grid is this exact expected arrangement of the green and orange objects, the hypothesis holds, and we should further expect pieces to only be combinable into a 3x3 square.",
    "c": "The input grid contains a black color background and two non-background color objects, in this case green and blue. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to rearrange these objects via translation and without rotation such that they fill into each other to create a single 3x3 square. In this case, we notice that the green Tetris-shaped object will slot nicely from the bottom into the whole of the blue object, thus making a 3x3 square as expected. The output grid should thus be exactly this 3x3 square grid with no black tiles. The two objects act as puzzle pieces that fill into each other to totally fill a 3x3 square. Because the output grid is this exact expected arrangement of the green and blue objects, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid contains a black color background and two non-background color objects, in this case red and aqua. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to rearrange these objects via translation and without rotation such that they fill into each other to create a single 3x3 square. In this case, we notice that the red L-shaped object fills nicely into the top right hole created by the aqua object. This makes a 3x3 square as expected. Output grid should thus be exactly this 3x3 square grid with no black tiles, consistenting of only the red object and the aqua object in their appropriate relative locations while filling in each other like puzzle pieces to form a single 3x3 square."
