  "thoughts": {
    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. Input grid is a 3x3 square, and the output grid is a 9x9 square. We note that the output grid's sides are integer multiples of the input grid, so perhaps that is relevant somehow to the transformation rule. The input grid contains an aqua colored shape with a black color background. The output grid contains a bunch of aqua colored shapes with more black colored background. If we view the output grid as a supergrid of 9 total 3x3 squares, arranged in a 3x3 supergrid array, we notice that the object in the input grid is copied across this 3x3 supergrid. Indeed, it looks like the input grid exactly is copied into a 3x3 supergrid, with each of these 9 sections containing a copy of the input grid. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. Regardless of what the size or shape or color of tiles that is in the input grid, in order to construct the output grid, we simply copy that input grid into a 3x3 supergrid in the output grid. The output grid will therefore be three times as tall and three times as wide as the input grid and contain 9 copies of the input grid.",
    "b": "Input and output grids are again different sizes. The input grid is a 2x2 square and the output grid is a 4x4 square. We note that this output grid is not three times larger than the input grid, and therefore out hypothesis needs to be refined. Input grid contains a blue color with a single black tile, and the output grid is again an exact copy of this input grid, but only copied two by two times. We notice the connection between the size of the input grid, which is 2x2, and the size of the supergrid that makes up the output grid, which is also 2x2. In the previous training pair, the size of the input grid was 3x3 and the size of the supergrid in the output grid was 3x3. Thus the amended hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be of some size, and contain some variety of colors of tiles. In order to construct the output grid, we need to make an appropriate number of copies of the input grid and place them into a supergrid which is the same size as the input grid's original size. For example, if the input grid is 3 tiles wide, then we need three subsection wide in the supergrid. If the input grid is 4 tiles tall, then we need four subsections tall in the supergrid, with each section of the supergrid containing a copy of the original input grid.",
    "c": "The input and output grids are again different sizes, as expected. The input grid is a 2x2 square. The input grid contains black and green tiles in a checkerboard-like fashion. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to make copies of the input grid and place them into the same number of sections as the size of the original input grid. In this case, we need to make a 2x2 supergrid in the output grid that is each comprised of an exact copy of the input grid. Thus the output grid will be a 4x4 tile square, because four total 2x2 squares arrange in a 2x2 supergrid would make a 4x4 tile square. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the amended hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "Input grid is a 4x4 square with a variety of red and black colored tiles scattered throughout. According to the hypothesis, In order to construct the output grid, we need to make copies of the input grid and place them into the same number of sections of a supergrid as the size of the original input grid. In this case, because we have a 4x4 tile input grid, we need to make a 4x4 supergrid, with each of the 16 sections being a copy of the 4x4 tile input grid. Thus the output grid will be a 16x16 tile grid. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the amended hypothesis holds, and we are even more confident now that the tile size of the input grid dictates the supergrid size in the output grid, because we have yet another different number example in this training pair.",
    "e": "The input grid is a 3x3 square with a variety of red and black colored tiles scattered throughout. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to make copies of the input grid and place them into the same number of sections of a supergrid as the size of the original input grid. In this case, because we have a 3x3 tile input grid, we need to make a 3x3 supergrid with each of the nine sections being a copy of the 3x3 tile input grid. Thus, the output grid will be 9x9 tile grid, where each subsection is simply a copy of the input grid. Because this is exactly what we see in the 9x9 tile output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "f": "Input grid is a 4x4 square with a variety of black and orange colored tiles scattered throughout. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to make copies of the input grid and place them into the same number of sections of a supergrid as the size of the original input grid. In this case, because we have a 4x4 tile input grid, we need to make a 4x4 supergrid with each of the 16 sections being a copy of the 4x4 tile input grid. Thus the output grid will be 16 by 16 tile grid, where each subsection is simply a copy of the 4x4 input grid. Because this is exactly what we see in the 16x16 tile output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "g": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a 5x5 square with a variety of black and aqua colored tiles scattered throughout. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to make copies of the input grid and place them into the same number of sections of a supergrid as the size of the original input grid. In this case, we have a 5x5 tile input grid square, and thus we need to make a 5x5 supergrid, where each of the 25 sections being a copy of the original 5x5 tile input grid. The output grid will therefore be 25 by 25 tiles large, and comprised of 5x5 subsections, each of which is a copy of the 5x5 tile input grid."
