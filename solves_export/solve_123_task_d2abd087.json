    "a": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid has a black color background with a variety of different shaped gray objects. Output grid contains those same objects with the same shapes in the same locations, but their colors have now changed from gray to either red or blue. There must be some type of rule that dictates which objects get turned into red or blue. The rule is likely associated with the shape of each object, so let's see if we see any similarity in the shapes of the blue objects or the shapes of the red objects. We notice that the red objects have exactly six tiles that make up those objects, and the blue objects have either 2, 4, or 5 tiles that make up those objects. So perhaps the color selection rule has only to do with the number of tiles within the object and not anything to do with the shape itself. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some color background, likely black, and then some number of non-background color objects, in this case likely gray. In order to construct the output grid, the background color and objects' locations and shapes stay exactly the same, but the colors of the objects will change to red or blue according to some color selection rule. The best guess for the color selection rule is that if the object contains exactly 6 tiles it is changed to red, and otherwise the object is changed to blue. We would appreciate more infromation to support or deny this selection rule hypothesis.",
    "b": "The input grid has a black color background with a variety of different shaped gray objects, in this case only three objects. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we copy over the input grid's objects and background into the same locations but the objects need to be changed to red or blue based on the color selection rule. The current hypothesized color selection rule is that any object that contains exactly 6 tiles in it will be changed to red, and any other object with some other number of tiles will be changed to blue. In this case, there are two objects with 6 tiles and one object with 5 tiles. The two objects with 6 tiles are changed to red in the output grid, and the other object is changed to blue. Thus the hypothesis and the color selection rule holds.",
    "c": "As expected the input grid has a black color background with a variety of different shaped gray objects. There are seven gray objects in this case. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we copy over the input grid's objects and background into the same locations, but the objects' colors need to be changed to red or blue based on the color selection rule. Any gray object in the input grid that contains exactly 6 tiles in the object will be changed to the color red, and any gray object that contains any other number of tiles will be changed to blue. In this case, there are two gray objects that will be changed to red color because there are two gray objects that contain exactly 6 tiles, and the other five gray objects will be changed to blue. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect based on this hypothesis, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a black color background and some number of gray objects in it. In this case, there are five gray objects. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we copy over the input grid's objects and background tiles into the same locations, but the objects' colors need to be changed to red or blue based on the color selection rules. Any gray object in the input grid that contains exactly 6 tiles in the object will be changed to the color red, and any gray object that contains any other number of tiles will be changed to blue. In this case, there are two gray objects that need to be changed to the color red. The object in the top right of the input grid, and the object in the middle left part of the input grid both will need to be changed to red color in the output grid because they have exactly 6 tiles in their objects. All other gray objects in the input grid will change to blue color in the output grid because they have some other number of tiles, either more or fewer than 6 tiles, in their objects. Thus the output grid should contain two red objects (the objects with 6 tiles) and three blue objects, with the shapes of each object being the same as the shape of each corresponding gray object in the input grid, and the rest of the tiles being the background color."
