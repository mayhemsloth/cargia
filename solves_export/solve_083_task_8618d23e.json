    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. The input grid consists of 4 different colors, blue orange pink and gray tiles. It seems to be split into two halves: the top half and the bottom half. The top half has a checkboard pattern of orange and blue. The bottom half is a checkboard of pink and gray. We notice that each of these halves is present in the output grid, but now in slightly different locations because of the difference in size of the output grid compared to the input grid. The additional space in the output grid is occupied by a winding purple path, that now appears on the right side of the top half pattern and then splits the top and bottom half with a horizontal line, and then appears on the left side of the bottom half pattern. Thus the hypothesis is the following: the input grid will contain a top half and bottom half checkboard pattern, or at least some well defined pattern, of different colors. In order to construct the ouput grid we need to expand the input grid by one row and one column. Then the top half pattern is placed into the top left corner of the output grid, and then the bottom half pattern is placed into the bottom right corner of the output grid. The additional tiles remaining are filled with purple, winding on the right in the top half, and then horizontally in the middle, and then down the left in the bottom half of the output grid.",
    "b": "Input and output grids are again different sizes. The input grid this time consists of two different colors, yellow on top and black on bottom. according to the hypothesis, the input grid should contain a top half and bottom half of some well defined pattern of differen colors. In this case it's just a single tile of yellow and a single tile of black, which is well-defined enough. In order to construct the output grid, we need to add one row and one column to the input grid and place the top half pattern, in this case a single yellow tile, into the top left, and then the bottom half pattern, in this case a single black tile, into the bottom right of the output grid. The additional remaining tiles need to be purple. Because this is exactly what is shown in the output grid, a winding purple path with the single yellow and black tile in their correct place, the hypotehsis holds.",
    "c": "The input and out grids are again different sizes as expected. The input grid in this case consists of two separate patterns, again split into a top half section and a bottom half section. according to the hypothesis, In order to construct the output grid, We need to add one row and one column to the input grid. Then we should place the pattern in the top half in the top left corner and place the pattern in the bottom right in the bottom right corner. The rest of the output grid is filled with purple tiles, creating a winding path of purple in the output grid. Because this is exacly what is shown in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. the input grid consists of two patterns, one stacked on top of each other, creating a top half and bottom half sections. According to the hypothesis, we start consturcting the output grid by adding one row and one column to the input grid to get the size of the input grid. Then we place the top half pattern exactly as is into the output grid in the top left corner of the output grid. WE place the bottom half pattern of the input grid exactly as is in the bottom right pattern of the output grid. The rest of the content of the output grid is purple tiles, filling in the empty space on the right side in the top half, and then creating a horizontal line in the middle to split the two halves, and then the purple winding path going down the left side column in the bottom half of the output grid."
