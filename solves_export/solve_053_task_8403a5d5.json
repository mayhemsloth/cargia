    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid is almost entirely a black background with a single green tile at the bottom. We notice that the output grid has a bunch of green tiles along with two gray tiles. So we are likely looking at some type of transformation rule that dictates how we are supposed to grow the non-background color tile that's at the bottom of the input grid. My hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some single tile color at the bottom of the input grid. To construct the output grid, we this tile color vertically straight up, and then continue to grow it in a snake-like fashion to the right. first we would turn to the right and label that as a gray meaning that we skip that column, alternating every other column with green. Notice, however, the gray tile appears at the bottom of the output grid after filling in the vertical columnm with green. This is why I described it as a snake-like pattern. We are traversing up, and then to the right, and then down, and then to the right, and then up, continuing until we hit the output grid edge. I would like some additional examples so that I can reinforce this hypothesis further.",
    "b": "The input grid is again an entirely black background except for one single tile on the bottom, in this case red. we notice in the output grid that the red has been snaked along the entirety of the output grid to the right. Thus the hypothesis holds. In order to construct the output grid, we must first vertically grow the red tile all the way to the top edge. Then we move to the right with a gray tile, signifying that we are skipping this column and moving to the next one past it. This next column is then filled with red tiles, effectively growing the tiles down until we hit the bottom edge of the input grid. Now that we are at the bottom edge, we need to continue traversing to the right, But remember, we place a gray tile first on the bottom edge in the next column, signifying that we are skipping this column and going on to the next one. The pattern continues and we grow vertically until we hit the top edge, and then move to the right one column with a gray tile and then continue onto the next column to go vertically down and so on. We continue this pattern until we've hit the far right edge of the output grid. In both pairs, we ended up filling the far right column with the vertical line, but it could be the case that we end up stopping with the labeling of the furthest right column with a gray tile, either on the top or bottom, whichever we are in the pattern. What matters is that we stop at the edge of the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid.",
    "c": "The input grid and output grid are the same sizes. The input grid is again a almost entirely black background color with a single yellow tile at the bottom. According to the hypothesis, we need to construct in the output grid a yellow line that snakes to the right. We initially grow the line vertically to the top edge of the input grid. and we move to the right one column, labeling that column with a gray tile at the top edge, Thereby skipping it. Moving to the next column, we now fill that with yellow moving down until we hit the bottom edge. We again go write one column and fill the bottom row of that column with a gray tile thereby skipping it. Moving on to the next column, we fill that column with yellow until we hit the top edge. We continue with the pattern and move to the right one column labeling it with a gray tile on the top row. According to the pattern, we would need to continue this into the next column, but we've already hit edge of the output grid, which as we recall is the same size as the input grid. Therefore, we are done and the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. the input grid and output grid are the same sizes. The input grid is almost entirely black background color, but with a single tile at the bottom somewhere. In this case, we have a blue tile. According to the hypothesis, we grow this blue tile vertically in a straight line up until we hit the top edge of the input grid. We move to the right by one column labeling this column with a gray tile at the top row, signifying that we are skipping over it and going on to the next column. Thus the next column will be vertically entirely blue. And when we hit the bottom edge of the input grid, You move to the right one column and label the bottom row of this column with a grey tile, identifying that we are skipping over this column. We continue this pattern until until we've hit the right most column in the output grid. In this case, the rightmost column in the output grid will be labeled with a gray tile in the bottom row. The rest of the input grid is copied over as is. That is, the background color stays black wherever we aren't growing the blue lines or gray tiles."
