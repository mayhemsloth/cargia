Input grid has some number of blue, aqua, and pink tiles in it. The output grid also has some number of blue, pink, and aqua tiles in it. We notice immediately that the left half side of the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid. Additionally, the right half side of the output grid looks very similar to the left hand side except that it is mirrored over its vertical edge. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be of some size and contain some number of different colored tiles. in order to construct the output grid, which is double as wide and the same height as the input grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is as the left half of the output grid. Then, the right half side of the output grid is filled by the mirrored version of the input grid, mirroring over the right edge of the input grid. Thus the ouput grid in its entirety will be symmetric across the vertical center axis of the output grid.",

According to the hypothesis, the input grid should be some number of colored tiles, And in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid exactly as is onto the left half of the output grid. The right half of the output grid is a mirrored copy of the input grid that has been mirrored over its right vertical edge. Thus, the output grid should have a mirror symmetry about the center vertical axis. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid the hypothesis holds.",

According to the hypothesis, the input grid should be some number of colored tiles, which in this case is pink and blue tiles. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid exactly as is onto the left half of the output grid. The right half of the output grid is a mirrored copy of the input grid that has been mirrored over its right vertical edge. The output grid should thus have a mirror symmetry about the center vertical axis. because this is exactly what we see in the output grid the hypothesis holds.",

According to the hypothesis, we need to copy over the input grid into the left half side of the output grid. The right half side of the output grid is a mirror copy of the input grid mirrored over its right edge. because this is exactly what we see in the output grid. The hypothesis holds and we have very strongly confirmed the hypothesis.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a 3x3 square composed of aqua, blue and pink tiles. According to the hypothesis, the output grid needs to be times as wide as the input grid, and so in this case it will have 6 columns wide and 3 rows tall. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is into the left half side of the output grid. The right half side of the output grid is a mirrored copy of the input grid that has been mirrored over its right vertical edge.
