    "a": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid contains a single red horizontal line, along with scattered blue tiles on a black color background. Output grid has a solid. Back on the color section on top, above the red line, and below the red line, all the tiles have been converted to blue. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a horizontal line of some color, probably red, which splits the input grid into two different sections. The rest of the input grid will contain some scattered number of single non-background colored tile, in this case blue. In order to construct the output grid, we must fill in the bottom section of the input grid with the same color as the scattered tiles, and we must fill in the top section of the input grid with the background color. Note that there may be some other selection rule that tells us what section needs to be what color. I will need additional training pairs to be confident in this hypothesis as currently formulated.",
    "b": "Input and output grids are again the same size. According to the hypothesis, there should be in the input grid a single horizontal red line. with a jagged diagonal red line, so the hypothesis needs to be amended. The rest of the input grid contains a scattering of gray tiles with black background tiles. The new amended hypothesis is the following. Input grid will contain some number of red tiles that establish a boundary, that splits the input grid into two separate sections. These red tiles do not need to be in an exact horizontal or diagonal line, but will be in some pattern that clearly defines a boundary. In this case it's a jagged red boundary. The input grid will also contain a random scattering of background and non-background color tiles. In order to construct the output grid, We copy over the location of the red boundary exactly as is, and then fill in the top section with the background color and the bottom section with the non-background color that is present in the input grid.",
    "c": "Input grid again contains some red boundary with a scattering of aqua tiles and black background color tiles. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify this red boundary layer that divides the input grid into two separate sections. In this case, the boundary layer is a thick diagonal red line. We copy over this diagonal line in the exact location in the output grid. The bottom part of the output grid is thus filled in with the non-background color, in this case aqua. While the top section of the output grid is filled with the black background color. Because this is what we see in the output grid the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid contains a red shape which acts as a boundary that divides the input grid into two different sections, along with a scattering of purple tiles and black color background tiles. According to the hypothesis this red boundary is copied over exactly as is into the output grid. The bottom section of the output grid should be colored with the purple tiles, and the top section of the output grid should be colored with the black background color."
