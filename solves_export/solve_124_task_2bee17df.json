    "a": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid has an aqua object spanning most of the top and right edges, and a red color object spanning most of the bottom and left edges. The interior part contains a black color background. The output grid contains these exact aqua and red objects in the same shape and locations. However, in the output grid, there are now multiple green vertical and horizontal lines that span some parts of the interior black section of the input grid. It seems like the only difference is indeed these additional green lines. How do we know where and how many green lines to draw? It looks like the ends of the green lines must touch the red object and the aqua object, which means the green lines can never be made with both ends touch the same color object. The lines also are the longest possible lines that can be drawn in this way in the interior black section. In this case, there just happens to be two columns that have the longest vertical line from aqua to red of 10 tiles total, and also two rows that have the longest horizontal line from aqua to red of 10 tiles total. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain two non-background colors that each span two of the edges. In this case it was aqua and red. The interior of the input grid will be the background color of black. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is, but add some number of green horizontal or vertical lines. These green lines must traverse from one of the non-background colored objects to the other, and they must be the longest potential vertical or horizontal line. All columns or rows that satisfy this requirement should be colored in with a green line. Note that we don't know yet if the longest line is determined by the maximum of both horizontal and vertical distances, because in this case they happen to be the same tile total. We need more training pairs to be sure of this.",
    "b": "The input grid again contains a black color background interior, with some part of the two edges covered with a red object and other parts of the two edges covered with an aqua object. According to the hypothesis, we need to copy over the input grid to the output grid as is while also adding in some number of green horizontal or vertical lines. In order to identify where these green lines should be created, possible horizontal or vertical line that exists in the input grid that start at one color and end at the other color. When we do this, we notice that there are four horizontal lines that satisfy this with a total length of the line at 10 tiles. However, we notice in the input grid that there are 6 horizontal green lines, including ones that have their both of their ends terminating at aqua tiles. Thus our hypothesis needs to be amended. The amended hypthosis is the following. The input grid will contain two non-background colors that each span some portion of two of the edges. In this case, it was aqua and red colors. The interior of the input grid will be a black background color. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is, but also add some number of green horizontal or vertical lines. These green lines can traverse from any edge object color to any other edge object color. These lines must only be the longest potential vertical or horizontal line in the interior black color section. In this case again, the total tile length was 10 for the longest line possible in both the vertical and horizontal directions. We still want more training pairs to be sure if this longest value is determined independently in each direction, or if there's only a single longest line value.",
    "c": "As expected, the input greatly contains a black color background interior with some part of the two edges covered with a red object and other parts covered with an aqua object. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we first copy over the input grid as is to the output grid but also need to add some number of additional green horizontal or vertical lines in the interior background color part of the input grid. In order to identify where these green lines should be, we need to find the longest possible vertical or horizontal line in the interior section. these lines can span from either color of the colored edge objects to either color of the colored edge objects. In this case, that is an 8 tile long line in two rows and one column. Each of these green lines should thus be created in the appropriate place in the output grid. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a black color background interior with some part of the two edges covered with a red object, and other parts of the edges covered with an aqua object. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we first copy over the input grid as is to the output grid, but also need to add some number of additional green horizontal or vertical lines in the interior background color part of the input grid. In order to identify where these green lines shuld be, we need to find the longest possible vertical or horizontal line in the interior black section. These lines can span from either of the red or aqua objects. We identify the longest line to be a 12 tile long horizontal line that is possible in three different rows. Additionally, there are three columns that have a 12 tile long vertical line in the interior black section. For each of these identified rows and columns, the output grid should have a green line instead of the black interior background color. Thus the output grid should contain three horizontal green lines and three vertical green lines, along with the original red and aqua objects."
