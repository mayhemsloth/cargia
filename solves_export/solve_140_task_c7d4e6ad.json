    "a": "The input and output grid are the same sizes. The input grid contains a black color background and two distinct objects. One object is a single color gray, and the other object is a single vertical line composed of three different colors, purple, pink and yellow. This multicolored vertical line is the same height as the solid gray object. The output grid looks very similar to the input grid with the exception that the gray object is now also a multi-colored object. All other tiles are identical to the input grid. Specifically, the gray object has been changed to be purple, pink, and yellow, similar to the vertical line in the input grid. Any tile in the gray object that is in the same row as one of the tiles in the multicolored line is changed to that color. For example, The two rows on the top of the gray object are changed to all purple tiles, and then the next three rows are changed to all pink tiles, and finally the next three rows are changed to yellow tiles. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some color background probably black. We will also contain a single color object, probably gray. It will also contain some indicator line of multiple non-background colors. This indicator line will likely be as tall or wide as the single color object. In order to construct the output grid, we must effectively color different sections of the single color object with the colors provided to us by the indicator color, and all other tiles are exactly the same. In this case, the indicator line is vertical, which means the different rows in which those sections of the vertical line are located indicate which tiles to change the single color object to in the output grid. However the indicator line may be horiztonal as well, but more training pairs will let us know if that is that case.",
    "b": "The input grid contains a black color background and two distinct objects. One object is a single color of gray, and the other object is a single tile wide vertical line composed of two different colors, aqua and red. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively color the gray object with the appropriate colors as indicated by the indicator line and copy over the rest of the input grid as is to the output grid. In this case, the top three rows of the gray object should be changed to aqua colored tiles, because the indicator line has the top three tiles as aqua. the rest of the indicator line is red and thus the rest of the gray object with rows in the same rows as that red section should also be changed to red tiles. because this is exactly what we see in the output grid with a newly changed aqua and red object, the hypothesis holds.  Note that we again encountered a vertical indicator line, but it very well may be horizontal as well, and the reasoning would still hold to align color be the equivalent sections in the vertical or column directions.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid contains a black color background along with a single gray object and a vertical indicator line. This indicator line consists of multiple colors, and in this case four colors, red green, yellow, and orange. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively color in sections of the gray object with the same colors as indicated by the indicator line, with the rest of the tiles being an exact copy of the input grid. In this case, the top two rows of the tiles in the gray object should be changed to red, and then the next three rows of the gray tiles should be changed to green, and then a single row of gray tiles is changed to yellow, and finally a single row of gray tiles in the gray object should be changed to orange. The rest of the tiles outside of the gray object, which will be changed to a multicolored object, will be copied over as is."
