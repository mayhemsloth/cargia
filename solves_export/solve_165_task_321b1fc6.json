In this case, there are three aqua objects of the same shape and then one pink and orange object of the same shape. The output grid looks very similar with the exception that the aqua objects have been changed to pink and orange tiles, copying the original pink and orange template object, which no longer exists in the output grid and has been replaced by the back color background tiles. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a background color, probably black. It will also contain some number of single color objects which all have the same shape, along with a differently colored object which also has the same shape, which will be referred to as the template object. In order to construct the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid, we need to copy the color pattern from the template object into the objects of the same shapes, and then also erase the template object from the output grid.",
    "b": "The input grid contains a black color background with a variety of different colored, same shaped objects. In this case the shape is a 2x2 square. Three of these objects are all aqua colored, and one is a pattern of multiple colors. According to the hypothesis, this patterned object is the template object. In order to construct the output grid we need to copy over this pattern from the template object into the aqua colored objects, while keeping the shapes in the same relative locations as in the input grid, and additionally remove the original template object and replace it with the black color background tiles. The rest of the output grid is the same as the input grid, including the size. Because this description is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a black color background with a variety of different colored, same-shaped objects. Three of these objects are all aqua, and one is a pattern of multiple colors, in this case yellow and green. According to the hypothesis, this patterned object is the template object. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over this color pattern from the template object into the aqua colored objects, while keeping the object shapes in the same relative location as in the input grid. Additionally, we need to remove the original template object and replace it with the black color background tiles. The rest of the output grid is the same as the input grid, including the size. This should result in a total of three green and yellow patterned objects in the output grid."
