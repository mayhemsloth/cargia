    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. We notice specifically that the input grid is a 4 by 4 square, and the output grid is an 8 by 8 square the input and output grids have the same sort of colors all over themselves in them. the fact that the output grid can be described as a two by two sections of four by four tiles hints at a possible multiple copy and paste of the input grid to the output grid. Upon closer inspection, we see that the top left 4x4 square of the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid. The other subsections of the output grids are also exact copies, but they are rotated with respect to the initial input grid orientation. For example, the top right 4x4 section of the output grid is nearly the same as the 4x4 input grid, but with the input grid rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees first. the bottom left 4x4 section of the 8x8  output grid is nearly the same as the 4x4 input grid. but it has first been rotated by 180 degrees. the bottom right 4x4 section of the output grid is nearly the same as the 4 by 4 input grid. but it has first been rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be of some size, likely square and contain a variety of colored tiles. The output grid will be a 2x expand version of the input grid. The top left section of the output grid will be an exact copy of the input grid. Then the top right section will be an exact copy, but first rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. The bottom left section will be the input grid, but first rotated 180 degrees. Finally, the bottom right section of the output grid will be the input grid but first rotated 90 degrees clockwise.",
    "b": "The input grid is again a 4x4 grid containing a variety of different colors. The output grid is an 8x8 grid which is consistent with our hypothesis that the output grid is made of different rotated copies of the input grid. according to our hypothesis, The top left 4x4 section of the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid, which it is. The top right four by four section in the output grid is also a copy of the input grid but first rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. The bottom left 4x4 section in the output grid is also a copy of the input grid, but first rotated 100 degrees. bottom right section of the output grid is also a copy of the input grid, but first rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Thus the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid is again a 4x4 square that has a variety of colors in it. The output grid is also an 8x8 square with a variety of the exact same colors, which seems to be consistent with our hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, the top left 4x4 section of the output grid is an exact copy of the 4x4 input grid. The top right 4x4 section of the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid but first rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. The bottom left 4x4 section of the output grid is also a copy of the input grid but first rotated 180 degrees. the bottom right 4x4 section of the output grid is also a copy of the input grid that has been first rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Thus, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "The input grid is another 4x4 square of a variety of colors. Does not really matter what the colors are or how they are arranged It just matters that we make copies of them in the output grid. According to the hypothesis, the output grid needs to be an 8x8 grid, comprised of four copies of the input grid, With some of the copies rotated. Again, the top left 4x4 section is an exact copy of the input grid that has not been rotated. The top right 4x4 section of the output grid is a copy of the input grid, but first rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise. The bottom left 4x4 section of the output grid is also a copy of the input grid, but first rotated by 180 degrees. Finally, the bottom right 4x4 section of the output grid is a copy of the input grid, but first rotated by 90 degrees clockwise. The hypothesis holds with this new pair.",
    "e": "The input and output pairs satisfy the hypothesis. I've seen enough of these pairs to now be very confident that our hypothesis is correct.",
    "f": "We apply the hypothesis here. We see a variety of colors in the input grid that is 4 by 4. The output grid is thus 8 by 8. and can be described as four copies of the input grid but with slight rotations applied to them before putting them down in the output grid. In the top left 4x4 section of the output grid, we have an exact copy of the input grid that is not rotated. in the top right 4x4 section, According to the hypothesis, We need a copy of the input grid that has first been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. In the bottom left 4x4 section, we need a copy of the input grid that has first been rotated 180 degrees. Finally, according to the hypothesis, we need in the bottom right 4x4 section a copy of the input grid that has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Once the output grid is constructed like this, the hypothesis holds."
