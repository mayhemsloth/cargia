    "a": "The input and output grids are the same size. We notice in the input grid a specific pattern of pink, green, gray, and orange. And the rest is aqua. The specific pattern is an 11 by 11 square. The Pattern can be described by having two separate columns of alternating pairs of colors. The columns themselves take turns, in an interleaved manner. One column consists of pink, gray, pink, gray, pink, gray, and so on. The other column consists of green, orange, green, orange, green, orange. Which one we start with at the topmost row is dictated by the previous column of that type. For example, if we start with pink on the top of a pink gray pink gray column, then the next column that needs to have a pink and gray pattern should start with a gray tile instead of a pink tile. Like wise for the orange green orange green column pattern. So how do we arrive at the output grid? We Notice that the bottom right corner of the pattern in the input grid is the same as the bottom rightmost corner of the output grid pattern. So if we imagine moving the input grid pattern and sliding it into the bottom right most part of the output grid, that establishes the starting pattern for filling out the rest of the output grid. For every column, we simply extend the like pattern. and when filling out new columns to the left. You have to reference VVS. hair color. column switch off whichever one it starts with. In this case, the newest column to the left, after we have tucked this shown section into the bottom right of the output grid, is an orange green orange green column, starting with orange on the bottom most row in the column. Hypothesis is that A complex repeating pattern of columns will be established in the input grid. We must slide that pattern as is to the bottom right corner and, then fill out the output grid of the same size as the input grid, repeating the established pattern.",
    "b": "Okay Seems like the hypothesis needs some fine tuning. We have a single layer, really only two edges, of a background color of blue. IIf we were to slide this pattern to the bottom right and fill in to the left and to top the rest of the columns, it would not match the output grid. Notably in the input grid at the bottom right of the pattern is gray. the color in the output grid's bottom right most tile is red. Thus the rule can't just be simply sliding it to the bottom right corner. My next hypothesis which is consistent with both this pair and the previous pair of input and output grids is that, before Filling in the rest of the background with pattern, We first move pattern to the left by one column, effectively removing that column and introducing a new background column on the right. in both cases shown so far. If we do that and then continue the pattern in both the vertical and horizontal directions, then we arrive at the output grids in both examples.",
    "c": "This input grid we have three alternating columns interleaved with each other. we notice that the first column is orange, pink, orange, pink. The second column is pink, green, pink, green. The third column is green orange green orange. Whenever we would need to reuse a column, we start the pattern with the opposite color of the column that we previously started on. According to the hypothesis, we need to move the entire pattern to the left by one column, and then that's our starting position to fill out the rest of the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid. In this case, the output grid Leftmost column will start with pink and then go down the line alternating green, pink, green, pink. The next column will start with green and alternate orange, green, orange, green. Then the next column. is orange, pink, orange, pink, orange, pink and so on. Remember that we repeat the pattern of the columns and whenever we would need to use a column we must start with the OTHER color that we didn't start with before, the last time we used that pair of colors column.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. we identify in the input grid that the first column has pink and aqua, and The second column also has aqua and pink, which means that there is only one single type of column. In order to get the output created started, we must move the input grid pattern to the left by one column, and start the output grid with that pattern there. In this case, that means starting with Aqua in the top left, filling in that column with pink, aqua pink, aqua pink. the next column with thus Start with pink, and alternating down the line with aqua pink, aqua pink, and so on. We continue this pattern of alternating columns until the output grid Has the same number of total tiles as the input grid, filled with only the colors of the pattern."
