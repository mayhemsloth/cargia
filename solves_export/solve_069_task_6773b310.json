    "a": "Input and output grids are very different sizes. Usually when this happens the input grid has some type of code that indicates how large the output grid should be and the exact colors of the output grid are also encoded by some information in the input grid. We immediately notice that the input grid is subdivided by a supergrid of horizontal and vertical aqua lines. They are spaced evenly such that they create nine subsections, We have a black color background and some number of pink tiles in each of them. We note the connection between the supergrid being of size 3x3 and the output grid also being of size 3x3. this is probably a hint that there is some type of rule that's telling us which subsections to select, and thus which corresponding tiles to change to the indicator color in the output grid. Inspecting further the different subsections of the input, we notice that for the pink tiles, there are either one or two in each of the subsections. In the subsections that there are two pink tiles, the corresponding output grid is labeled with a blue indicator tile instead of the typical black background. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be some size and have a super grid made of vertical and horizontal aqua lines. Each subsection in the input grid will have a black color background with some number of pink tiles in it, or potentially some other color. In order to construct the output grid, we have to find the subsections that contain two pink tiles. The output grid will be the same size as the supergrid of subsections, in this case a 3x3 tile grid, and all tiles will be black background color with the exception that the corresponding locations of the subsections that contain two pink tiles should instead be labeled with a blue tile.",
    "b": "The input grid is again composed of a super grid with aqua horizontal and vertical lines. There are 9 total subsections in a 3x3 grid, with a black background color and pink tiles in each of the subsections. According to the hypothesis, we need to construct the output grid of the same size of the supergrid, which is 3x3. Output grid should be the black color background with the exception of blue tiles. These blue tiles are in the exact corresponding locations of the selected subsections. We know which subsections need to be selected because they are the subsections with two pink tiles in them. In this case, the far right column, middle row has two pink tiles, and the bottom left subsection has two pink tiles in it as well. Because the output grid has these exact corresponding locations colored as blue, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid is yet again a super grid made up of vertical and horizontal aqua lines that divide the input grid into subsections, 9 in total. Subsections have a black color background and some number of pig tiles in them. According to the hypothesis, we need to construct the output grid by first identifying which of the subsections have two pink tiles in them. We've identified that we can label the output grid with. blue indicator tile colors in the corresponding locations as the subsections that contained those two pink tiles. In this case, the top right corner and the very center of the three by three square output should be blue, because those corresponding subsections in the input grid have two pink tiles. Because the output grid shows exactly this, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "Again, we have an input grid that is a super grid with aqua horizontal and vertical lines. There's a three-by-three supergrid of subsections containing black color background and pink tiles. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify which subsections have true pink tiles in them. corresponding locations of those subsections in the output grid need to be labeled blue Output grid is otherwise a 3x3 square with a black color background. Because this is exactly what the output grid is with three blue tiles in the correct locations, the hypothesis holds.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid consists of a supergrid with aqua, horizontal, and vertical lines, splitting the input grid into nine total subsections. Each subsection contains a black color background with some number of tiles located in a subsection. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify which subsections contain two pink tiles. The corresponding. locations in the output grid of these subsections need to be turned to the color blue. Otherwise, the output grid is a 3x3 black color background. In this case, there are four subsections that have two pink tiles, and therefore the output grid should also have four total blue tiles."
