    "a": "The input and output grids are not the same sizes. We notice specifically that the input grid is six columns wide and three rows high while the output grid is three columns wide and three rows high. because of the integer multiple scaling of the output grid to the input grid, we may be needing to find some type of pattern in the input grid and select it as the output grid. Looking at the input grid now, we see that there are an assortment of yellow, pink, and aqua tiles. The output grid also has an assortment of yellow, pink, and aqua tiles. We notice specifically that the input grid is two copies of the output grid but placed side by side to each other. The integer multiple of the differences of the sizes of the input grid and the output grid helped us to see this connection. So the hypothesis is the following: The input grid will have some combination of colors, but will ultimately be some patterned subsection that is repeated by some number of times. In this case, it's repeated only once, side by side, but it may end up being repeated more than once on top of each other or side by side as well. The output grid thus needs to be the subsection of patterned colors which has been repeated (some number of times) in the input grid.",
    "b": "Again, we see input and output grids that are not the same size. and specifically the input grid exactly half the width of the output grid. Looking at the input grid more closely, we notice that the left half of the input grid is an exact copy of the right half of the input grid, and that there's no further copies that can be identified smaller than that. We expect the output grid to be one such instance of this subsection, in this case the entire left section of the input grid. Because the output grid is exactly that pattern of blue green and red, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input and output grids are, again, different sizes. In this case, the input grid is twice as tall as the output grid. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify in the input grid some repeating subsection of colors. In this case, we have a red, green, and yellow colors. we can identify by visually translating candidate subsections, placing them on top of other subsections to see if they perfectly align in color. We noticed that the top half of the input grid is an exact copy of the bottom half of the input grid. According to the hypothesis, The subsection can be copied in either direction, left, right, up, or down, and in this case it looks like it was copied vertically up and down. Thus we expect the output grid to be this two column wide, three row tall subsection of red green and yellow. Because the output grid is exactly this subsection the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify some subsection of the input grid that is copied with respect to itself. The subsection can be vertical or horizontally copied. Once we've identified this subsection, that pattern is the exact output grid. Input grid has gray, yellow. pink and red tiles in it. notice a checkerboard-like pattern of gray and yellow tiles. However this pattern doesn't go the entirety of the input grid, so that can't be the subsection. When the checkboard like pattern starts again is likely when the subsection repeats. Indeed, The top half of the input grid and the bottom half of the input grid are exact copies of each other. According to the hypothesis, this three column wide and four row tall subsection of the input grid needs to be exactly copied into the output grid as is, and is the entirety of the output grid. Thus taking the top half of the input grid as the output grid."
