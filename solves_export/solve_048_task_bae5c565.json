    "a": "The input and output grids are the same size and they have similar colors throughout. Very likely, we need to use some type of information in the input grid to construct the objects in the output grid. The input grid has a gray background with a single vertical aqua line in the very center column. the top row of the input grid has an assorted amount of colors, in every column except the column that has the aqua vertical line already in it. We notice in the output grid that these corresponding colors produce vertical lines in the same columns in which they are in the first row in the input grids. However, the height of these vertical lines in the output grid is dictated by the proximity to the height of the center vertical aqua line. The hypothesis is the following. In the input grid, there will be some color background and some vertical or potentially horizontal line. Then there will be a row or column of different color tiles. In our case, this is a row of colors at the top. then new lines are constructed of these colors. The height of these lines is dictated by the proximity to the already existing line. Specifically, the lines gradually step down in height from the center. So if the center line was eight tiles tall, then the lines directly adjacent to the center line would be seven tiles tall. The lines adjacent to the lines that are 7 tiles tall would be 6 tiles tall, and so on, moving down in a stepwise fashion. These lines are again colored the same color as the indicator tiles at the top.",
    "b": "Input grid is again a gray background with a vertical aqua line in the middle column, starting from the bottom row, of some height. There are a bunch of other colored indicator tiles on the top row except for the column that the aqua line already exists. For each colored non-background color tile at the top We must construct a vertical line growing from the bottom up to a specific height. That height is dictated by the proximity to the original center AquaLine. In this case, two purple lines adjacent to the aqua center line will have a height of five tiles from the bottom, because the aqua line is six tiles high. According to the hypothesis, we need to step down one tile in height for every column that we go away from the center line. Note that although I'm saying the center line, it could be the case that The aqua line is not necessarily centered. the hypothesis would still hold. We identify the height of this line and decrease the height of the new drawn lines by one every step away from the original line. Note that the indicator tiles at the top row go away in the output grid and are replaced with grey background.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. We again ave a grey background with an aqua vertical line in the center of the input grid. At the top of the input grid, there's a row of different colored indicator tiles. For each indicator tile at the top, we need to draw a vertical line, starting from the bottom up to a certain height. According to the hypothesis, that height is dictated by the proximity to the center line. For example, the purple line to the left of the center aqua line will need to be five tiles high because the aqua center line is six tiles tall. green indicator tile in the column directly to the right of the aqua line column will also need to be five tiles high. for every column that we move away from the center column, We must decrease the height of the new drawn vertical lines that we palce in the output grid.  the indicator tiles at the top go away and are replaced with grey background."
