    "a": "The input and output grids are the same size. The input grid has a black background with three distinct 2x2 square objects of red. Notice that the output grid also has three distinct 2x2 square objects, but two of them are now aqua and one of them is still red they're located in the same relative positions as in the input grid. there's likely some rule that dictates which of these red squares need to turn into aqua. Based on this pair alone, my hypothesis is that any red square gets turned to aqua if, when that red square would be extended in any orthogonal direction would intersect with another red square. In this case, the leftmost square and the rightmost square would intersect with each other if they were extended or grown to the right and to the left. The Bottom middle red square would not intersect with any of the other red squares if it were grown up, down, left, or right.",
    "b": "We again have an input and output grid. that are the same sizes. We also have a black background and a variety of red squares. However, the previous hypothesis seems to be wrong and is not supported by this pair. There must be some other rule that... dictates which of the red squares get turned into aqua squares and which stay the same color red. Some other potential rules Could be something like if they're touching the edge of the input grid, then they need to be changed to aqua. However, this hypothesis is wrong because in this pair we find two red squares that have been turned to aqua that do not touch the edge of the input grid. I'm not sure what the hypothesis is at the moment and I think I need another pair to give me additional information to make a more educated guess.",
    "c": "Okay this pair helped a lot and I think I have it. We notice in this pair that the input and output grids are longer than they are tall. So naturally, I am able to identify and look at the squares as if they are in a sequence from left to right more easily than I would have in the other pairs shown already. I notice now that the input grid red squares that are turned to aqua are seemingly alternating in order from right to left. So the hypothesis is the following. starting from the right-hand side of the input grid. we identify In order From right to left, the red squares as we encounter them traveling from right to left. The first red square that we encounter is changed to aqua the next red squares remains as red. The next red square encountered changes to aqua and so on in this alternating pattern. This hypothesis, when applied to the previous pairs, also gives us the output grid. Note that we know that we must start from the right hand side because the previous pair's leftmost red square is not aqua. In every output grid so far, there is always an aqua square all the way on the right. Thus this is the hypothesis.",
    "d": "the hypothesis holds in this pair. We identify in the input grid the right-most red square. and in the output grid in that exact location we change that square to aqua. Then moving from right to left, We color the remaining squares red and aqua alternatingly. Background color remains black and the input and output grids are the same size.",
    "e": "The hypothesis again holds for this pair. We first identify the rightmost red square and change it into aqua in the output grid. Then moving from right to left, every square that we encounter. regardless of its height or vertical position, we will color either red or aqua, depending on the alternating pattern and whichever previous red square was colored. In this case, there are 9 red initially, Therefore, there will be five aqua squares and four red squares in the output grid, in the corresponding exact locations as in the input grid, but with the new aqua color assigned according to the rule.",
    "f": "we apply the hypothesis here. We first identify the rightmost square in the input grid and assign it the color aqua in the output grid. Then moving from right to left, we identify Each red square, regardless of its vertical position and color it either red or aqua, depending on the alternating pattern and where we are in the sequence. In this input pair, there are 7 total red squares, therefore the output grid will contain 4 total aqua squares and 3 total red squares. The input and output grids are the same sizes. The background color is black in both. And we are simply changing the color of the appropriate red squares, according to the hypothesis."
