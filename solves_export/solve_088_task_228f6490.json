    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid has a black color background with two rectangles that are gray These gray bounding box rectangles have some shape or hole in them. There are also a variety of objects in the input grid of different colors. We notice in the output grid that some of these objects of different colors have moved into the holes of the gray rectangles. The other objects that are not used remain. The hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a black color background with some number of gray bounding box rectangles. Each of these rectangles will contain some shaped hole in them. The input grid will also contain a variety of different color shaped objects, some of which will match the shapes of the holes. In order to construct the output grid, we need to make a copy of the input grid, but move these identified corresponding shapes into the holes of each of the rectangular bounding boxes. The unused objects remain in their exact location, and the gray objects also stay the same shape and location.",
    "b": "The input grid contains two gray bounding boxes, each with holes in them. On the black background, there are a variety of different colored objects, each with some shape. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify the objects that would entirely fill in the holes of the gray rectangles. Currently, according to the hypothesis, there is no rule about which shape to choose if there are multiple colors of the same shape to fill in the hole. In this such case, in the input grid, there is a hole that is two tiles wide and one tile tall. There are also two objects, a pink and and orange object, that both are those exact shapes. The output grid shows that the pink colored one filled in the hole. There's no clear reason why we select that one, so perhaps it's simply the one closer by distance, because the pink object is closer to the destination gray rectangle that it would need to go into. The other gray rectangle is a 2x2 square, and we see only one object, the aqua 2x2 square, that would fill that hole. Thus the output grid has the pink and the aqua objects moved to their respective locations, and the rest of the candidate objects remain. I would like to see another training pair that has multiple such objects in order to strengthen the hypothesis of the closer distance selection.",
    "c": "The input grid contains two gray bounding boxes, each with holes in them that are the black background color. Outside of the gray bounding boxes, there are a variety of different shapes and colors of objects. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify the objects that would entirely fill in the holes of the gray rectangles. Here we identify the red object in the top left corner of the input grid to satisfy the hole of the bottom left gray rectangle, because they are the same shape. Additionally, we identify the aqua object in the bottom right of the input grid to satisfy the hole of the top right gray rectangle because it satisfies the hole of the top right rectangle. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid to the output grid as is with the exception of moving the identified objects into the holes of the gray rectangles, filling the holes in entirely. The other unused shapes remain. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a black color background with two gray rectangular bounding boxes, each of which has a shaped hole in it. There are a variety of different objects of different colors in the exterior space of the input grid. According to the hypothesis we need to identify which objects have shapes that can entirely fill in the holes inside of the gray rectangles. In this case, the orange shape on the left side of the input grid will fill in the top gray rectangle hole, and the yellow line shape in the right side of the input grid will fill in the line shape hole of the bottom gray rectangle. In order to construct the output grid, we copy over the input grid as is with the exception of moving these identified shapes into their corresponding locations to fill in the holes. The rest of the objects in the exterior in the input grid remain. The gray rectangles stay as is in the same location as well."
