    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid contains a black color background and one vertical and one horizontal pink line across the input grid. There is also a a 1x3 gray rectangle object in the top right corner of the input grid. The output grid also contains a black color background and vertical and horizontal pink lines, but those pink lines are in different locations than it originally was in the input grid. The gray tiles are no longer present in the output grid. It seems like the intersection of the pink lines has been moved by some amount of tiles. How do we know how many tiles to move it and it what direction? Perhaps the gray rectangle object tells us. We note that the intersection made by the pink lines has moved to the left three tiles and down three tiles. The height of the gray object is three, so perhaps that's where the vertical movement came from. However it's not clear where the amount for the horizontal movement came from. We don't have a solid hypothesis quite yet so we will wait for another training pair in order to make one. The hypothesis will very likely involve moving the intersection, and therefore the horizontal and vertical lines, some direction and amount of tiles.",
    "b": "The input grid contains a black color background and one vertical and horizontal yellow line across the input grid. There is again a 1x3 gray rectangle object in the top right corner of the input grid. The output grid has a black color background and two perpendicular yellow lines, but now located in different positions as in the input grid. Just as in the first training pair, this intersection has been moved to the left and down by 3 tiles in each of those directions, with the lines moving to their appropriate locations to make the intersection in that spot. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a black color background with a single horizontal and vertical line of some non-background color spanning the height and width of the input grid, therefore making a single intersection somewhere. In the top right corner of the input grid will be a gray rectangle of some height, probably 3. In order to construct the output grid, the intersection of those two lines will need to be moved to the left and down by the same amount as the height of the gray rectangle.",
    "c": "The input grid contains a black color background and one vertical and horizontal green line across the input grid. In this case, the gray rectangle object in the top right corner is only 1 tile tall. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively move the intersection and the positions of the lines creating that intersection of the non-background color tiles by some amount down and left. The amount is dictated by the tile height of the gray object in the top right corner of the input grid. In this case, the intersection needs to move down one tile and left one tile in the output grid. Additionally, the gray object goes away and is replaced by the black background color. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "The input grid contains a black color background and one vertical and one horizontal red line across the input grid. In this case, the expected gray rectangle object in the top right corner is 2 tiles tall and one tile wide. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to translate the intersection and positions of the lines of the non-background color tiles, in this case, red, by some amount down and left. The amount to move is dictated by the tile height of the gray object in the top right corner of the input grid. In this case, the intersection needs to move down two tiles and left two tiles in the output grid. Additionally, the gray object goes away in the output grid and is replaced by the black color background. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a black color background and one vertical and one horizontal aqua line that spans the input grid. There is a gray rectangle object that is 2 tiles tall and 1 tile wide in the top right corner of the input grid. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively translate the intersection and positions of the lines of the aqua tiles by some amount down and left. The amount to move is dictated by the tile height of the gray object in the top right corner of the input grid. In this case, the tile height is 2, so the intersection needs to move down two tiles and left two tiles in the output grid from its starting location in the input grid. Additionally, the gray object goes away in the output grid and is repalced by the black color background. Note that the output grid is the same size as the input grid."
