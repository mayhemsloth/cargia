    "a": "Input and output grid are different sizes. Usually this means that the output grid is some type of indicator or flag for each tile that corresponds to some type of operation on subsections of tiles in the input grid. Indeed, we notice that the output grid is 3x3 tiles large and the input grid has 6 columns and three rows, which can also be described as two 3x3 squares placed next to each other. We noticed in the input grid that there is a black color background and in the left half of the input grid, there are only yellow and black tiles, and on the right side, there are only green and black tiles. All of these facts point us to a likely overlay operation of the two halves of the input grid to arrive at the output grid and which specific tiles are activated with pink. When we overlap the left-hand side with the right-hand side of the input grid, We notice that the output grid contains ink tiles wherever there are either yellow tiles or green tiles in this overlapped construction. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain two halves of some sort with a black color background. In order to construct the output grid, which will be half the size of one of the dimensions of the input grid, we need to overlap each half with the other half and then do or operation. That is, we effectively label with pink in the output grid any tile in the overlapped construction where either half has a non-background color present. If they both have a non-background color tile represented, that's okay, and we still label that relative location with the pink indicator tile. Note that there is no rotating or mirroring or anything in the overlap construction, we simply lift one half and overlay it onto the other in a simple translation and overlap mechanism.",
    "b": "Input grid is again six columns wide and three rows tall and the output grid is 3 by 3. According to the hypothesis, we need to overlap the left-hand side of the input grid with the right-hand side of the input grid and do an OR operation, effectively labeling the output grid with pink tiles where either the left side or the right side of the input grid contains a non-background color tile. In this case, there are only four such tiles that overlap and satisfy the OR operation, Thus, there will be four pink tiles located in the output grid, with the rest as the black background color. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be with this hypothesis, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "input grid is again six columns wide and three rows tall with the output grid being three by three, with a black color background. Additionally there are yellow tiles in the left side and green tiles on the right side. According to the hypothesis, we need to take the left half side and overlap it with the right half side of the input grid, and do an or operation with this overlapped construction. Wherever there are green or yellow tiles in this overlapped construction, the output grid should contain a pink tile as an indicator tile in the same relative location in the 3x3 overlapped construction. In this case, there will be five such pink indicator tiles. Because the output grid shows exactly what we expect for this for operation, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "Once again the input grid is the size we expect it to be with the left hand side being yellow tiles on a black background and the right half side being green tiles on a black background. Or it's the hypothesis we need to over Overlap the left hand side with the right half side of the input grid. Within this overlap construction, we need to do an OR operation, and label the output grid with pink tight indicator tiles wherever there exists either a yellow tile or a green tile in the overlapped construction. The output grid in this case will be nearly full of pink tiles, with only a single black color background tile in the top left corner of the 3x3 output grid. because this is what is shown in the output grid the hypothesis holds.",
    "e": "We feel confident enough that our hypothesis is correct at this point. Input grid and output grid show exactly what they should be with yellow green and pink tiles exactly where I expect them to. The output grid is the result of an or operation of the left-hand side and right-hand side of the input grid, thus the hypothesis holds.",
    "f": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a left half and a right half, with the left containing yellow tiles in a 3x3 square and the right half containing green tiles on a black color background in a 3x3 square. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to overlap the left half side and the right half side and perform an or operation on this overlapped construction. Output grid should be a 3x3 grid with pink indicator tiles present wherever there is either yellow or green tiles present in the overlapped construction. In this case, there will be 6 total pink colored tiles in the output grid, with the rest of the tiles as black color background.",
    "g": "we apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a left half and a right half with the left containing yellow tiles and a 3x3 square on a black color background and the right half containing green tiles on a black color background in a 3x3 square. of the hypothesis. In order to construct the output grid, we need to overlap the left half of the input grid and the right half of the input grid and perform an OR operation on this overlapped construction. Output grid should be a 3x3 grid with pink indicator tiles present in the same relative location wherever there is either yellow or green tiles present in the overlapped construction.
