    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. The input grid appears to be four subsection rectangles, divided into these subsections by one horizontal and one vertical yellow line. All the subsections have a black colored background and a single non-background color tile in them: in the top left subsection are orange tiles, in the top right subsection are purple tiles, in the bottom left subsection are red tiles, and in the bottom right subsection are aqua tiles. The non-background colored tiles are scattered seemingly at random within each subsection. Each rectangle is four tiles wide and five tiles tall. The output grid is a combination of all the non-background color tiles as well as a couple of background color tiles. It is also four tiles wide and five tiles tall. The size of the output grid matching the exact size of each subsection seems to imply that we need to overlap the different subsections in some order in order to construct what should be shown in the output grid. How do we determine what the order should be? We notice in the output grid that the aqua tiles in the input grid's aqua subsection are all present, so likely that subsection is the last one to be layered on top. It appears that the black background color acts as holes that are not filled in by that subsection and instead can show through the previous layers. For example, in the aqua subsection, the bottom right corner is the black background tile. In both the orange and purple subsections, that tile is orange and purple respectively. However the output grid shows an orange tile. Which probably means that the orange subsection layer comes after the purple subsection layer, because the orange tile is covering up the purple tiles wherever they overlap. From the output grid, we see that the red tiles is the fewest, and most likely the red subsection is the first subsection layer to be placed down and thus the color most likely to be covered by the three additional subsection layers that will go on top of it. It seems for now the order of construction is simply based on the color: red, then purple, then orange, then aqua. It may also be based on the relative positions of these subsections, but we will need more training pairs to determine if that is the case. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain four subsections, all with a common background color, probably black. This subsections will be equal size and will be separated by a single horizontal and a single vertical yellow line. Each subsection will have a single non-background color, with tiles scattered seemingly at random within the subsection. We expect the colors to be orange, purple, red, and aqua. In order to construct the output grid, which will be the same size as one of these subsections, we need to effectively start with a background color tile in all of the output grid, and then layer the different subsections on top of each other, covering up all the tiles with that color wherever there are non-background color tiles. The layered subsections are placed down in this order: red, then purple, then orange, and then aqua. Any time there is a background color tile in the layered subsection, that acts effectively as a hole that allows the layer that was already there to stay the same color tile.",
    "b": "The input grid appears to be four subsection rectangles divided into these subsections by one horizontal and one vertical yellow line. All the subsections have black color background and a single non-background color tile in them. There are orange, purple, red, and aqua subsections. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, which will be the same size as one of the subsections in the input grid, we need to start with a full background color grid and then effectively layer each of the subsections in a specific order on top of each other, treating the background tiles as holes that allow the previous layers placed down to appear through. The specific order is the red subsection, then the purple subsection, then the orange subsection, and then the aqua subsection. Each successive layer on top occupies and covers up all the other placed tiles with its non-background color tiles. Because red is first, it will likely have the fewest number of tiles present in the output grid. The aqua tiles in the output grid should always contain the exact aqua tiles in the same locations as the aqua subsection. Because this description is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid contains four rectangular subsections divided by yellow vertical and horizontal lines. All the subsections have black color background and a single non-background color tile in them. There are orange, purple, red, and aqua subsections. Accoridn to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid which will be the same size as one of the subsections in teh input grid, we need to start with a full background color grid and then effectively layer each of the subsections in a specific order on top of each other, treating the background tiles as holes that allow the previous layers placed down to appear through. The specific order is the red subsection, then the purple, then the orange, and then the aqua.

Because red is first, it will likely have the fewest number of tiles present in the output grid. Teh aqua tiles in the output grid should always contain teh exact aqua tiles in the same locations as the aqua subsection. Any black color background tiles that survive all the layers will simply be kept as the black color background in the output grid. Because this description is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "As expected, the input grid contains equally sized orange, purple, red, and aqua subsections divided into subsections by horizontal and vertical yellow lines. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to layer these subsections on top of each other in the order of red, purple, orange, and then aqua. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect and because our hypothesis has held up in the previous two training pairs, we are very confident about the hypothesis.",
    "e": "As expected, the input grid contains equally sized orange, purple, red, and aqua subsections divided into subsections by horizontal and vertical yellow lines. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to layer these subsections on top of each other in the order of red, purple, orange, and then aqua. The output grid starts as all background color of the same size as each subsection of the input grid, and then the red layer is put down, and then the purple, and then the orange, and then the aqua subsection layer. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect and because our hypothesis has held up in the previous training pairs, we are very confident about the hypothesis.",
    "f": "The input grid contains equally sized rectangular subsections. Yellow horizontal and vertical lines divide the input grid into these subsection. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to layer these subsections on top of each other in the order of red, purple, orange, and then aqua. The output grid thus starts as all background color of the same size as each subsection of the input grid, and then the red layer is placed down, and then the purple, and then the orange, and then the aqua subsection layer. The background color tiles act as holes that allow any previously placed layer's tiles to continue to persist in the output grid. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be, our hypothesis holds and we are extremely confident about it.",
    "g": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is divided by one horizontal and one vertical yellow line into four equally sized rectangular subsections. Each subsection has the black color background and a single non-background color, with those tiles scattered in each subsection seemingly at random. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively layer these subsections on top of each other in the order of red, purple, orange, and then aqua. The output grid will thus start as a full background color tiles, of the same size as each subsection, and then the red subsection layer is placed down. The background color tiles in each subsection layer act as holes and do not change the color of the tile that was already there in that same relative location. Next, the purple subsection layer is placed down, and wherever there are purple tiles those purple tiles will cover up and take over the color of those tile locations. The next subsection layer to place down is the orange layer, and doing the same construction, the final layer is the aqua subsection. Because the aqua color is last, all aqua tiles in the input grid subsection should be present in the output grid."
