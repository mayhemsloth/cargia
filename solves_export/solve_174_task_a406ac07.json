    "a": "The input and output grids are the same size. The input grid is a mostly black color background with two of the edges, the right edge and the bottom edge, containing a single layer of multiple colors. There are gray, pink, orange, aqua, and purple tiles present. They seem to have a diagonal symmetry to the order of the colors, such that the same color in the row of the vertical edge is always in the corresponding column of the horizontal edge. The output grid looks similar to the input grid with the exception of additional gray, pink, orange, aqua, and purple tiles. It seems like this diagonal symmetry is important to understand the location of the added colored tiles. For example, the gray tile is added in the output grid only at where the intersection of the rows and columns that the gray tiles are located at the edges. In this case, there would be only one tile intersected, so there is only one gray tile added. For the pink tiles, there is a 2x2 square placed in the exact location where the two pink tiles on each edge would have intersected. The same rule applies to the 3x3 tile orange square. These orange tiles are located in the rows and columns where both the vertical and horizontal edges contain orange tiles, and no where else. It seems like the output grid is adding corresponding color tiles in the exact locations wherever the row and column edges are the same colors as each other. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be of some size and be mostly some color background, probably black. Two of the edges, one vertical and one horizontal, will contain some number of non-background color tiles. Very likely these tiles will have a diagonal symmetry to them. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid with the exception of adding a certain number of tiles. To determine which tiles to add where, we add colored tiles in the exact locations wherever the row and column edges are the same colors as each other, following this diagonal symmetry.",
    "b": "The input grid is a mostly black color background with two of the edges, the right and bottom edge, containing a single layer of multiple colors. There are purple, aqua, orange, pink, and gray tiles present. They have a diagonal symmetry to the order of the colors, such that the same color tile in the row of the vertical edge is always in the corresponding column of the horizontal edge. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, Ww need to copy over the input grid as is with the exception of adding some specific colored tiles in the correct place. We need to add corresponding colored tiles in the exact locations wherever the row and column edges are the same colors as each other. For example, the top two rows in the vertical edge is purple, along with the left most two tiles in the horizontal bottom edge, so there will be a 2x2 square of purple tiles added where these purple tiles would intersect, along the diagonal of the output grid. The same process is similarly repeated with the rest of the colors present in the edges. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid is a mostly black color background with two of the edges, the right and bottom edge, containing a single layer of multiple colors. In this case, there are aqua, yellow, gray, and green tiles present. They do not have an exact diagonal symmetry to the order of the colors. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is with the exception of adding some specific colored tiles in the correct places. We need to add corresponding colored tiles in the exact locations wherever the row and column edges are the same colors as each other. We can still apply this hypothesis without exact diagonal symmetry. For example, in this case, the top three rows of the vertical edge are aqua, and the left two columns of the horizontal edge are also aqua. This means that the corresponding object will be a 2 tile wide and 3 tile tall rectangle in the top left corner of the output grid, because those are the exact locations where the row and column colors match in the interior of the output grid. We do the same thing for all the other colors present in the horizontal and vertical edges. This training pair taught us that we do not necessarily need exact diagonal symmetry and we should just ensure to follow the exact location rule. Because the output grid is what we expect it to be, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a mostly black color background with two of the edges, the right and the bottom edge, containing a single layer of multiple colors. In this case, there are green, yellow, pink, purple and orange tiles present. They do not have an exact diagonal symmetry, but we ahve learned that they do not need to be. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is with the exception of adding some specific colored tiles in the correct places. We need to add corresponding colored tiles in the exact locations wherever the row and column edges are the same colors as each other. we can still apply this hypothesis without exact diagonal symmetry. For every color present, we need to identify the interior locations that the same row and columns have that color and color those tile locations the appropriate color."
