This multicolored object has yellow in the interior layer and then red around the yellow layer and then green around that red layer. The output grid has this same aqua color background, but the multicolored object is now gone. Nearby, a yellow layer of tiles has been added to the output grid. Upon inspection, we see that the yellow tiles added in the output grid are in the exact location that would have extended a layer on the object. Thus the hypothesis is the following. Input grid will contain a similar color background, likely aqua, and some multicolored object. In order to construct the output grid, we copy over the input grid as is, with the exception that we replace that multi colored object with the background color and also add a single layer of colored tiles around where the object used to be. The color of the object is likely the inner most color of the multicolored object. It may also just be a continuation of the pattern established in the layers of colors, but we will need more training pairs for us to be certain of that. Note that the single layer are only tiles directly adjacent to tiles in the object, the layer does not include diagonally adjacent tiles.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are again the same sizes. The input grid contains an aqua color background with a multi-color object in it. layer and a green exterior layer around all of the interior blue tiles. according to the hypothesis in order to construct the output grid we need to copy over the input grid as is except we need to replace a multi-color object with the background color, and also add an additional single layer of tiles around the object. The color of this single layer around the object is determined by the innermost layer of the object, which in this case is blue. Remember that the single layer only includes tiles that would be directly adjacent to the object tiles, and diagonally adjacent tiles are not included in the single layer. Because the output grid contains an additional single layer of blue around the object, with the object changed to the background color, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains an aqua color background with a multi-color object in it. In this case, that object has a green interior and a yellow exterior. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we must Copy over the input grid into the output grid, except replace the multicolored object with the background color aqua. Additionally, we need to add a single layer of tiles around the object, in the color of the inner most layer of the multi-colored object. In this case, that additional single outer layer will be green. Recall that the additional outer layer is only for tiles that are directly adjacent to the tiles in the multicolored object and does not include diagonallly adjacent tiles. Thus the output grid should contain only green and aqua tiles, with the green tiles in the appropriate places where they would constitute an additional adjacent tile layer around where the object used to be."
