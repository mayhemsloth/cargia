    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. The input grid has 9 rows and 4 columns, and the output grid has 4 columns and 4 rows, so it's a 4 by 4 square. We notice that the input grid has a horizontal yellow line in the middle row, effectively splitting up the input grid into a top half and bottom half, each of which is a 4x4 square. This is the same size as the output grid. The top half of the input grid has blue tiles and black tiles, which is presumably the background color because the bottom half also has black tiles with some additional red tiles. The output grid has green tiles and black tiles in it. Because the input and output grids are different sizes, and because of the connection between the sizes of the two subsections of the input grid with the output grid size, this transformation rule points to some type of operation done on the top half and the bottom half to arrive at the output grid. We notice in the output grid that the green tiles cover up nearly the same as the blue tiles in the top half of the input grid, with the exception of the additional top right corner of the 4x4 output grid. The bottom red half of the output grid happens to have a red tile in that exact relative location. Very likely then the output grid is simply an OR operation of the top half and bottom half subsections of the input grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be of some size and contain a horizontal yellow line in the center of it. This horizontal line splits up the input grid into two separate, equal-sized subsections of the top half and the bottom half. These two subsections will have a common color background color, which in this case is black, and some other tiles will be labeled with some other color. In order to construct the output grid, we need to overlap these two subsections and perform an or operation on the overlapped construction. That is, wherever there are tiles colored the non-background color in either the top half or the bottom half those tiles in the same reletive location will be colored the indicator color of green in the output grid.",
    "b": "As expected, the input and output grids are different sizes. The input grid is again 9 rows tall and 4 columns wide, and the output grid is a 4x4 square. According to the hypothesis, the input grid should contain a horizontal yellow line that splits the input grid into two equal-sized subsections. In this case, the top half again has blue tiles on a black color background and the bottom half has red tiles on a black color background. In order to construct the output grid we must overlap the top section with the bottom section and do an or operation on the non-background color tiles. In this case, whenever a tile's location is covered up with either a red or a blue tile, then the corresponding relative location in the output grid will be colored green. Whenever neither the top or bottom half has a red or blue tile in that relative location, the output grid tile will contain the background color of black. the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be after doing the overlapping mechanism, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "Input grid contains a horizontal yellow line with two subsections. The top half is a 4x4 square, and the bottom half is also a 4x4 square. The top half has blue tiles on a black color background and the bottom half has red tiles on a black color background. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we must first overlap the top half with the bottom half and do an OR operation on the colored tiles. wherever either a blue or red tile is present in this overlapped construction the output grid gets a green color tile there. Wherever neither is present, the output grid gets black background color tile. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "As expected, the input grid has a horizontal yellow line with a top and bottom subsection containing red and blue tiles. According to the hypothesis, we need to do an OR operation on the overlapped subsections and then label the output grid with green tiles wherever that OR operation is true. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be, the hypothesis holds, and we are now very confident in the hypothesis.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a horizontal yellow line that splits the input grid into two subsections of equal sizes. The top section is a 4x4 square with black color background and blue tiles. The bottom section is also a 4x4 square with black color background and red tiles. According to the hypothesis, we need to take the top subsection and overlap it with the bottom section and then do an or operation on the overlapped construction. The output grid, which is the same size as the subsection of 4x4, is then colored with green tiles in the same relative locations wherever either there is a blue or red tile present in the overlapped construction, and then colored with the black color background tiles wherever there is neither a blue nor red tile present in the overlapped construction."
