    "a": "input and output grid are drastically different sizes. We notice immediately that there area variety of different colored 3x3 square objects in the input grid on a solid black color background. The output grid is an exact of one of these 3x3 squares. because of the input grid size difference and the exact copy nature of the output grid, the transformation rule probably involves some type of signal or indicator in the 3x3 squares composition that dictate which 3x3 square we need to choose to be in the output grid. That's what we should do now is look at the input grid and focus on the differences between the different 3 by 3 squares themselves. We notice that three of the squares, the ones that are not chosen, all have only two colors that make them up. For example, there's a red and green square, a blue and orange square, and a purple and yellow square. The square that has been chosen to be the answer in the form of the output grid has three non-background colors, aqua, pink, and gray. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a black color background with a bunch of equal-sized shapes. One of these shapes needs to be selected to be the exact output grid. The selection rule, right now, seems to be that if one of the objects has three non-background color colors of that object ought to be selected. It could also be the case that the selection rule simply selects the shape with the most colors as well, but we need more training pair examples to be confident in this hypothesis.",
    "b": "The input grid is a black color background with, again, four 3x3 square objects. All the objects are made of different colors. The output grid is again an exact copy of one of the 3x3 squares. According to the hypothesis, the selection rule that signifies which of the square objects to select is that object that has the most colors. In this case three colors, and it's the square made up of green, blue, and red colors. Because the output grid is exactly this 3x3 square, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid is a black colored background with four 3x3 square objects. Each object is made of different colors. According to the hypothesis, the output grid should be an exact copy of one of these 3x3 squares, that is, the selected square. The selection rule selects the square that is made up of three non-background colors, and thus we need to select the blue, pink, and red square. Because the output grid is exactly this square, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a black color background with four 3x3 square objects. Each of the square objects is made up of different non-background colors. Three of the square objects are made up of two unique colors, and one is made up of three colors. Acording to the hypothesis, the yellow, red, and purple square should be selected by the selection rule. Thus the output grid should be an exact copy of this 3x3 square object, and that's all there is to the output grid."
