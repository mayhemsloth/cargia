    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes, which usually means that there's a type of of rule in the input grid itself that we're trying to get. So perhaps the output created corresponds to some type of flag or toggle that signifies something about the state. of the input. Here we see a horizontal yellow line that spans the whole input grid which is likely acting as a barrier a boundary that splits the input grid into two different sections top and bottom we notice that the top and bottom input sections that are split by this yellow line are the same size as the output grid. Therefore, my hypothesis is that we have to overlay the top section. with the bottom section and see where there are still black backgrounds. are still black backgrounds present in the overlay of the two subsections. That is where we have the output grid be black. Wherever there's any red or blue tiles, in this case, the output grid will be green",
    "b": "Again, we see a horizontal yellow line. that acts as a boundary that is splitting up the input grid into two sections. top and bottom. We then want to overlay the top section with the bottom section and identify those tiles that are not covered by either red or blue. Those tiles that are not covered stay black and any other tile that is covered by either red or blue, is labeled green. Therefore, this type of operation is like an or switch where you're comparing the existence of either the red or blue colors in the corresponding spots when you overlay the top section and the bottom section.",
    "c": "We have another horizontal yellow. line that acts as a barrier for top section and bottom sections which are the same size as each other and the output. grid. When we overlay these two sections, we find that there are many spots that are still black, therefore those spots are labeled as black in the output grid. Any other spot that has red or blue in the tile will be labeled green.",
    "d": "The hypothesis still holds. We have a. horizontal yellow line, which splits the input grid into two equal sized subsections. To get the output, we want to compare the corresponding parts of the input grid subsections between the subsections of the input grid and the output grid subsections. other wherever there is at least one red or blue tile when you compare these different subsections with each other, then you label that section as green. Wherever there is no red or blue tiles, you keep that color as the background color of black.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. We identify the horizontal yellow line that splits the input grid into two equal subsections. top and bottom section, then we overlay or overlap the likewise corresponding parts and identify where there's either red or blue tiles, and label those in the output grid as green. Wherever there are not red or blue tiles we've labeled those as background color of black."
