    "a": "The input and output grids are not the same size. Usually when this happens, it means that we need to find some type of rule that dictates an indicator that determines what the output grid should be. We see in the input grid we have a black color background with three aqua objects. The output grid also has a black color background with three aqua tiles. The output grid is only 3 by 3. This pair alone is not enough information for me to have even a good guess at what the transformation rule is. I'm trying to look at the shapes of the three aqua objects to see if there's some similarity or dissimilarity with them that would indicate why I would place the three tiles in the output grid in the exact locations that they are. I think I need another pair to show off before I can make a good hypothesis. I do generally know what I'm trying to look for though. There must be some property of the objects in the input grid that determine how we indicate in the output grid.",
    "b": "Input grid and output grid are again different sizes. In this pair, the input grid has a black color background with four aqua objects. The output grid also has a black colored background within a diagonal line of four aqua tiles. The hypothesis could be as simple as counting. Without additional information, let's just make this simple hypothesis. The input grid will contain some number of single color objects. Let's call that number n. The output created will thus be an n by n square, with the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right being the exact tile color of all the objects in the input grid. No, there may be some more complex rules that could add on to this. for example, potentially the shapes have different colors and we are actually ranking them in the output grid by their sizes, and we just happen to get all the same color objects. So it looks as if we aren't ranking them and just counting them. We will need additional pairs and more information to support or deny this hypothesis.",
    "c": "The input grid and output grid are again different sizes, as expected. The input grid has a black color background with two aqua objects. Seems like our hypothesis is correct. Because there are two aqua objects, the output grid should be two by two, which it indeed is. Output grid has a black background color except on the diagonal from top left to bottom right, which are labeled with the color of the objects, in this case aqua. It seems like our simple hypothesis is holding. We are essentially counting the number of unique objects in the input grid and encoding that into the output grid in a specific way.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black color background with five different aqua objects. According to the hypothesis, we identify how many aqua objects there are. In this case, there are five. Thus the output grid must be a 5 by 5 square, filled mostly with the black background color. However, there needs to be an aqua diagonal line going from the top left to the bottom right corner of the square, with five total tiles being aqua, signifying that there were five distinct objects in the input grid."
