    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid contains a black color background and a set of parallel horizontal and vertical gray lines. There are two vertical gray lines and four horizontal gray lines, splitting the input grid into different shaped subsections. The output grid looks very similar to the input grid with the exception that some subsections are colored different colors instead of the black background color. The top left subsection of the output grid is now colored blue. The most middle subsection is now colored red, and the bottom right subsection of the output grid is now colored green. Because the relative positions are the only real pieces of information to tell us how to color which subsection, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a black color background with some number of horizontal and vertical gray lines that split the input grid into differently shaped subsections. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is and then change some specific subsections to different colors. Whichever subsection is in the top left corner of the input grid needs to be changed to blue. Whichever subsection is in the bottom right corner of the input grid needs to be changed to green. Whichever subsection happens to align exactly in the center, both horizontally and vertically, needs to be changed to red. Note that determining the middle subsection depends on how many total lines there are. Because there are two vertical lines, there are three vertical slices, so we need to find the middle vertical slice. Because there are four horizontal lines, there are five horizontal slices, so we need to find the third horizontal one, the middle of five. Note that this hypothesis is not very strong so we desire additional training pairs to strengthen the hypothesis.",
    "b": "The input grid has a black color background and gray horizontal and vertical lines. In this case, there are nine subsections created by the gray lines, in a 3x3 subsection grid. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is to the output grid, with the exception of changing some specific subsections. We need to identify the top left subsection and change that subsection, no matter how large it is, to blue. After identifying the bottom right subsection, we need to change that color to green. the very middle subsection of both horizontal and vertical slices should be changed to the color red. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds and we are now more confident in it.",
    "c": "Input grid is again a black color background with some gray horizontal and vertical lines. These lines create subsections in the input grid. The two horizontal lines slice up the input grid into three horizontal slices, and the four vertical lines slice up the input grid into five slices, so totalling 15 subsections in all. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is to the output grid with the exception of changing some specific subsections. The top left subsection of the output grid needs to be changed to blue instead of the black color background. The bottom right subsection of the output grid needs to be changed to green. The exact middle subection should be changed to red. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black color background and a set of horizontal and vertical gray lines. In this case there are four horizontal lines that split up the input grid into five horizontal slices. There's also four vertical lines that split up the input grid into five vertical slices. Therefore, there are 25 total subsections in the input grid. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is to the output grid, with the exception of changing some specific subsections. The top left subsection of the output grid needs to be changed to blue. In this case, this will be a single tile in the top left corner. The bottom right subsection of the output grid needs to be changed to green. In this case, that will also be a single tile in the bottom right corner of the output grid, that needs to be green. Finally, we need to change the exact middle subsection to red. Because there are five horizontal and five vertical slices, the middle subsection is the third slice horizontally and vertically. In this case that's a two tile wide and one tile high subsection that needs to be changed to red."
