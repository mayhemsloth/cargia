    "a": "The input and output grids are drastically different sizes. The output grid is a single tile. The input grid is a large grid with a black color background and a variety of different colored lines that look to be overlapping and on top of each other. because of the single tile output grid, we expect this to represent a selected color, and there must be some type of selection rule to apply to the state of the input grid to arrive at the one color we must use to put in the output grid. So what is special about the blue color in the input grid? The input grid has red, blue, and yellow horizontal lines as well as green and gray vertical lines. When these lines intersect, some of them take precedent over the others. We can say that those lines that take precedent and have their color exposed at the intersection are on top of the other line. For example, when the green and red lines intersect with each other, the green tiles appear in the intersection, which means the green line is on top of the red line. Similarly, when the gray line intersects with the red line, the gray tile appears at the intersection, which means the gray line is on top of the red line. We notice that the blue line is complete or whole, such that whenever it encounters an intersection with a different colored line, the blue line always wins out, and therefore can be thought of as being on the top of all the lines. All of the other lines are underneath some other line, with the exception of the blue line. Blue happens to be the color that appears in the output grid. This is likely the selection rule. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a background color, probably black. Some number of different colored lines that go across the entire input grid, and can be thought of as a pile of lines. These lines will intersect and can be thought of as being on top of each other, as if they are in a pile. We can determine the order of the pile of lines by looking at how they intersect and which color ends up on top at each intersection of any of the lines. In order to construct the output grid, which will be a single tile of one color, we need to use the selection rule to determine which color to select to be the single tile in the output grid. The selection rule tells us we need to select the topmost line in the pile of lines. In this case, that color is blue, and thus the output grid is a single blue tile.",
    "b": "The input grid has a black color background, with a variety of different single colored vertical and horizontal lines. There's a yellow and aqua vertical line, as well as a green and pink horizontal line. Therse can be thought of as a pile of lines. According to the hypothesis in order to construct the output grid we need to use the selection rule to find the single color whose line corresponds to the line being on top of the pile of lines. When looking at the input grid, we can determine which line is on top by selecting the one whose tiles are always present at any intersection with any other lines. For example, in this case, when the pink and yellow lines intersect, the pink tiles are present, and therefore the pink line is on top of the yellow line. When the pink line intersects with the aqua line, the aqua line tiles are present instead of the pink tiles. Therefore the aqua line is on top. We see that the aqua line is on top of all the other tiles that it intersects, and therefore it should be selected as the color of the single tile in the output grid. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid has a black color background with a variety of different single-colored vertical and horizontal lines. There's a blue and yellow horizontal line, as well as a pink, aqua, and red horizontal lines. These lines can be thought of as a pile of lines. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to use the selection rule to find the single color whose line corresponds to the line being on top of the pile of lines. We can determine which line is on top by selecting the one whose tiles are always present at any intersection with any other lines. For example, in this case, when the red line intersects with the yellow line, the yellow tiles are present and therefore the yellow line is on top of the red line. Then when the yellow line intersects with the pink line, the pink tiles are present and therefore the pink line is on top of the yellow line. In the input grid we see that the pink line, whenever it intersects with any of the lines it intersects with, always ends up on top of the intersecting lines, and therefore is complete and on top of the pile. Thus the output grid should be a single pink tile. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "The input grid has a black color background with only two different single colored vertical and horizontal lines. There's a green line horizontal and a blue vertical line. These lines can be thought of as a pile of lines. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to use the selection rule to find the single color whose line corresponds to the line being on top of the pile of lines. In this case, there are only two such lines, and it is straightforward to determine which one is on top of the other. At their intersection, the green tile is present and therefore the green line is complete and on top of the blue line. Because there are only two lines in the pile, we know that the green is the one that is on top, and so the output grid should be only a single green tile. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid the hypothesis holds.",
    "e": "The input grid has a black color background with a variety of different colored vertical and horizontal lines.

According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to use the selection rule to find the single color whose line corresponds to the line being on top of the pile. For example, in this case, at the intersection between the red and pink lines, the pink tiles are present and therefore the pink line is on top of the red line. We see that the pink line wherever it intersects any of the lines it intersects with, also has its tiles present at the intersections, and therefore is the only tile that is complete and is thus on top of the pile of lines. The output grid should then be a single pink tile. because this is exactly what we see in the output grid the hypothesis holds.",
    "f": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black color background with a variety of different colored vertical and horizontal lines. There are pink and blue horizontal lines as well as green and orange vertical lines. These lines can be thought of as a pile of lines. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to use the selection rule to find the single color whose line corresponds to the line being on top of the pile. We can do this by inspecting the intersections and finding which colored line's tiles always win out at any intersection that it is a part of. For example, in this case, the orange line intersects with the blue line and the orange tiles are present, therefore the orange line is on top of the blue line. Additionally, the orange line is also intersecting the pink line with the orange tile present at the intersection and therefore the orange line is on top of the pink line. Because the orange line is the only line that has its color present at all the intersections it encounters, it can be thought of as being on top of the pile of lines. Thus the output grid should be a single orange tile."
