    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid contains a gray color background and a single blue path-like object. This path-like object can also be described as a bounding box square with an opening. The output grid looks very similar to the input grid with the exception of additional red tiles. The blue path-like object is in the same location, but now there are red tiles inside of and outside of the blue path-like object. Specifically, in the output grid, the additiona red tiles filled in the interior of the blue object, as well as leaked out of the blue object's opening and then continued in a straight line until it hit the edge of the output grid. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be of some size and will be mostly a background color, probably gray. It will also contain some number of blue objects. These blue objects will look like a bounding box with an opening in it, so its not entirely a fully closed off bounding box. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is, with the exception of changing some of the background tiles to red. Specifically, the tiles that are changed are the background color tiles that are interior of the bounding box as well as a single line of tiles that protrude straight out of the opening of the bounding box, until it hits the edge of the output grid.",
    "b": "The input grid contains an aqua color background and two blue bounding box objects, each of them with an opening in them. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is with the exception of adding red tiles in specific places. We need to add red tiles to the interior of the bounding box as well as out through the opening of the bounding box in a straight line until it hits the edge of the output grid. Whatever the background color may be, those specific tiles need to be changed to red tiles. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid contains a purple color background and two blue bounding box objects, each of them with a single tile opening in them. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is, with the exception of adding red tiles in specific places. We need to add red tiles to the interior of the bounding boxes as well as out through the opening of each bounding box in a straight line until it hits the edge of the output grid. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a yellow color background in this case and three blue bounding box objects, each of them with a single tile opening in them. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is, with the exception of adding red tiles in specific places. specifically we need to add red tiles to the interior of the bounding boxes as well as out through the opening of each bounding box in a straight line until it hits the edge of the output grid. This must be done for all three of the blue bounding box objects. The blue bounding box objects with a single hole in them stay in the same location, and the rest of the untouched yellow background also remains the same."
