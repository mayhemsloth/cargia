The output grid is also a 3x3 tile square with black color background and purple tiles in an L shape, but this time it has been rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise, or it could have been flipped vertically about the horizontal center axis. We will not know unless there we get more training pairs, so we won't make a hypothesis quite yet. However, we can say that it is likely going to be a simple rotational or flipping transformation to change construct the output grid from the input grid.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are again the same sizes. The input grid is a 3x3 tile square with a black color background and some pink tiles. The output grid is also a 3x3 tile square with a black color background and pink tiles in a different orientation. We notice that the output grid is been rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise, which makes it now two such training pairs that support this transformation rule. Flipping this input grid vertically along the horizontal center axis does not get us to the shown output grid, but rotating by 90 degrees counterclockwise does. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some number of tiles, probably a 3x3 grid of black and some other color. In order to construct the output grid, we need to simply rotate the entire input grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise, and that will be the output grid.",
    "c": "The input grid is a 3x3 tile square with a black color background and some scattered red tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to rotate the entire input grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise, ensuring that all the tiles go into their appropriate relative locations after the rotation. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "The input grid is a 3x3 tile square with a black color background and some purple tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to rotate the entire input grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise. We need to ensure that all the tiles go into their appropriate relative locations after the rotation. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a 3x3 tile square with a black color background and some gray tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to rotate the entire input grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise. We should ensure that all the tiles go into their appropriate relative locations after the rotation."
