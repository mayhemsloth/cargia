    "a": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. input grid has a black background and a bunch of different colored objects Notice in the input grid that there are pairs of like objects. For example, there is. a blue object that looks like a bridge. and a pink object that looks like a bridge in the output grid both of these objects exist but in this case in the output grid both of them are now pink We notice further that there are three such pairs, and in each pair, one object is blue and one object is another color. In the output grid, there are no blue colored objects. So the hypothesis is the following. In the input grid, there will be a black background. with a variety of objects, some of which will be blue. or perhaps some other common color. For every blue object that exists, we need to find the corresponding colored object, not blue and not a black background color. and in the output grid that object needs to be changed into the color of the corresponding object the rest of the output grid is exactly the same as the input grid.",
    "b": "The hypothesis holds. In this case, the input grid has one distinct pair of blue and other colored objects. In this case, there is a plus sign That is a blue object and another plus sign that is aqua. Therefore, in the output grid, we need to... copy the input grid exactly, but with the exception of changing the blue plus sign object into aqua color., because that is the color of the corresponding shape for that distinct pair.",
    "c": "The hypothesis still holds. The input grid has a black colored background with many distinct objects. For each blue distinct object, there is a copy of that object somewhere else in the input grid. To get to the output grid we must identify the corresponding color of that paired object, and color each blue object with the corresponding color. The output grid is thus an exact copy of the input grid, with the exception that the blue objects are colored the appropriate color. Our hypothesis is supported by this input and output pair.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. In the input grid, we have a black background and we must identify all the distinct. object pairs that exist. In this case, there are five blue objects and five other colored objects. For each blue object, there is a corresponding other colored object. The output grid is thus a copy of the input grid with the exception that the blue objects must be colored to their corresponding In this case, one object is yellow, another object is pink, another object is red, and two of the pairs have aqua. Thus, in the output grid, we need two objects to be red, two objects to be yellow, two objects to be pink, and four objects total to be aqua. Remember, we must look at the shapes of the objects and pair them up in order to find out what the corresponding color should be."
