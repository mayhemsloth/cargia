    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid has a black color background with two objects, one yellow and one pink. Notice in the output grid that the pink shaped object is gone and the yellow object has grown. The yellow object in the output grid also has vertical symmetry. Specifically the yellow object in the input grid has been mirrored over itself to the right, with the original yellow object staying in the same place and the rest of the yellow tiles being added to the right of the original yellow shape. Because the pink object is gone in the output grid, the pink object is liekly an indicator object that tells us what type of mirror operation to do to the other object in the input grid. I would like to see more training pairs before making a solid hypothesis, but right now the hypothesis is that there will be a pink indicator object in the input grid that dictates how we mirror the other objects already present in the input grid. The output grid no longer contains this pink object, but it has the now symmetric version of the other objects.",
    "b": "Input grid again contains a pink object with another yellow object on a black color background. The pink object this time has a horizontal line with one tile on each side of the line, probably symbolizing that that line is the plane of symmetry and we need to mirror the yellow object over the horizontal edge of the yellow object. We do see in the output grid that the yellow object has added tiles in the downward direction, indicating additional tiles were added in a symmetric fashion over the bottom edge of the yellow object. The yellow object copied itself by folding over its bottom edge. What's still ambiguous is which edge to actually choose to mirror over for the yellow object. For example, in this case, if we were to mirror over the top edge, the rest of the yellow object would not fit within the bounds of the output grid, so we can assume that that is the wrong edge to choose. However in the previous training pair, the left edge and right right edge were both valid edges that could have fit the entirety of the mirror yellow object. there doesn't seem to be anything in the shape of the pink object to indicate which edge to choose to disambiguate, because the pink shape itself ahs been symmetric in both training pairs so far. We'll state a more confident hypothesis in the next training pair.",
    "c": "The input grid contains a black color background with a yellow object and a pink object. The pink object is a vertical line this time with one tile on each side, indicating that the yellow object needs to be mirrored vertically over one of its left or right edges. The output grid indeed shows that the yellow object has been mirrored over its right edge. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will have a black color background and a single yellow object and a single pink object. The pink object acts as an indicator to tell us which axis to mirror the yellow object when constructing the output grid. If the pink object has a vertical line, then we mirror the yellow object over one of its left or right edges, such that the resulting object has a vertical axis of symmetry. If the pink object has a horizontal line in it, then we mirror the yellow object over one of its top or bottom edges, such that the resulting object has a horizontal axis of symmetry. We choose the appropriate edge such that the entirety of the yellow mirrored object will appear in the output grid. If the additional yellow tiles that need to be added would fall outside the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid, then we know we can not choose that edge. The pink object does not appear in the output grid, and is replaced with black background tiles.",
    "d": "The input grid contains a black color background with a yellow and pink object. According to the hypothesis, the pink object acts as an indicator to tell us which axis to mirror the yellow object over. In this case, the pink object has a horizontal line, so we know we must choose either the top or bottom edge of the yellow object to mirror over. According to the hypothesis, if one of the edges would result in the additional yellow tiles falling outside of the bounds of the output grid, then we can't choose that edge. In this case, either the top edge or the bottom edge would be valid, because there's enough room on either side to mirror the yellow object over. Thus we could use both of our attempts at solving the output grid to put two different answers in and we would be sure to get one of them correct. In order to construct the output grid, we remove the pink object and add additional yellow tiles where appropriate to make the yellow shape mirrored over either its top or bottom edge in this case. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "e": "The input grid contains a black color background with a yellow object and a pink object. According to the hypothesis, the pink object acts as an indicator to tell us which axis to mirror the yellow object over. In this case, the pink object has a horizontal line with one tile on each side of the line, so we know we must choose either the top or bottom edge of the yellow object to mirror over. According to the hypothesis, if one of the edges would produce yellow tiles that fall outside the bounds of the output grid, then we can not choose that edge, and thus should choose the other edge option. In this case, the yellow object's top edge is along the input grid's top edge, so we know we can't mirror over that edge, and thus we choose the bottom edge instead. The output grid does not contain the pink object, and in this case we confirm that the yellow additional tiles can take up the pink object's previous location, which is probably why the pink object goes away in the first place. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be, the hypothesis holds.",
    "f": "We apply the hypothesis here. The inpuit grid contains a black color background with a yellow object of some shape and a pink object. According to the hypothesis, the pink object is an indicator to tell us how we should mirror the yellow object in the output grid. In this case, the pink object is a vertical line with one tile on each side of it, which indicates that the yellow object needs to be mirror in the vertical axis, such that it will contain vertical axis symmetry. Thus we need to choose either the rigth or left edge of the object. We notice that if we were to choose the right edge, because the yellow object is 4 total tiles wide, the mirrored part of the yellow object would fall outside of the bounds of the output grid, because there is only 3 total columns to the right of the rigth edge. Thus we know we must choose the left edge of the yellow object to mirror the yellow object over. In the output grid the pink object goes away, and the original yellow object is located in the same location as the output grid, and now there will be additional yellow tiles added by mirroring the yellow object over its left edge."
