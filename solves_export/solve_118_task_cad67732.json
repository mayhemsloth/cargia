    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. Input grid is a 5x5 square. The output grid is a 10 by 10 square. We note that the output grid is twice as wide and twice as tall as the input grid. The input grid is composed of black color background tiles with a diagonal red line going from the top left to the bottom right of the input grid. Some of the adjacent tiles of this diagonal red line are covered in gray tiles. This makes a pattern of diagonally adjacent 2x2 checkerboard squares, with the red color in the top left and bottom right of the 2x2 square, and the gray tiles occupying the top right and bottom left of the 2x2 squares. The output grid has this exact diagonal pattern across the entirety of the output grid, effectively extending the pattern into the rest of the now enlarged size of the output grid. The hypothesis is the following. Input grid will be of some size and the output grid will need to be twice as wide and twice as tall as the input grid size. The input grid will also contain a background color and some type of colored diagonal repeating pattern. In order to construct the output grid, we need to extend this non-background colored pattern diagonally, with the original input grid existing in the top left part of the output grid.",
    "b": "Input and output grids are again different sizes. In this case, the input grid is a 6x6 square and the output grid is a 12x12 square. The input grid contains a black color background with diagonal pattern going from the top left to the bottom right corners of the input grid. In this case, the pattern is made up of yellow, green, blue, and red tiles. According to the hypothesis, the output grid needs to be twice as tall and twice as wide as the input grid, and the top left portion of the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid. The rest of the output grid extends the established diagonal pattern in the diagonal direction until it hits the bottom right corner of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is the background color, in this case black.",
    "c": "The input and output grids are again different sizes. The input grid is an 8x8 square and the output grid is a 16x16 square, which is twice as wide and twice as tall as the input grid, which is expected. The input grid contains a black color background and this time has a diagonal line pattern starting in the top right and going to the bottom left corner of the input grid. This is unexpected and we need to amend our hypothesis. the amended hypothesis is thus the following. The input grid will be of some size and contain a diagonal line pattern from some corner to the opposite corner of the input grid. In order to construct the output grid, we need to double both sides of the input grid and then place a copy of the input grid into a corresponding corner of the output grid. For example, if the diagonal pattern starts in the top right corner, we'll place the input copy into the top right. If the diagonal pattern starts in the top left corner, then we should place the input copy into the top left corner of the output grid. The directionality of the diagonal line then dictates how we expand the diagonal line in the output grid. For example, in this case, the diagonal line continues in the down and left direction with alternating blue and pink tiles.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid is a 10 by 10 square, and according to the hypothesis, the output grid needs to be twice as wide and twice as tall as the input grid, and thus needs to be a 20 by 20 tile square. The input grid contains a diagonal line pattern of pink, yellow and aqua tiles that starts in the top right corner and ends in the bottom left corner of the input grid. The rest of the input grid has a black color background. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify the directionality of the diagonal line and put a copy of the input grid into the appropriate corner. In this case, the input grid copy should be placed into the top right section of the output grid. Then, to construct the rest of the output grid, we extend the diagonal line pattern down and to the left, repeating the established pattern until we hit the bottom left corner of the 20x20 sized output grid. Note that it isn't enough to copy the input grid into the bottom left part of the output grid, we need to continue the pattern and ensure the diagonal line pattern continues as it is established in the input grid diagonal line pattern. The rest of the output grid where the diagonal line pattern does not exist is the background color of black."
