    "a": "The input and output grids are not the same size, they are very different sizes. you notice that the input grid has a bunch of red objects in it and the output grid has a bunch of red tiles in it So likely we need to somehow arrange different sections of the input grid to create the output grid. We notice in the input grid that there are five such red objects separated by a black background. The output grid also has a black background. My rough hypothesis is that we have to use the red objects in the input grid to somehow create a path from the green starting block to the bottom of the output grid. I think this makes sense. starting with the left most object in the input grid, We place that object in the horizontal center of the output grid near the top. In this case, the first such object is two Vertically aligned red tiles and then a red tile on the left of those vertical red tiles. This represents the path turning. Note that the top most tile placed will be labeled as green. Then we proceed with the next red object, which in this case is two vertical red tiles with the adjacent tile on the right. This topmost tile is placed on top of or overlaid on the tile that had turned the path. The next object also has a turning of the path. We place the topmost tile of that turned path onto the turned path of the previously placed tile. When the path does not need to turn, we simply extend downwards the path immediately. Which is exactly what happens with the final two red objects. I think with another pair this hypothesis will be clearer and I will state it more clearly.",
    "b": "The input grid again consists of five separate red objects. The output grid is a path that has been constructed with those five red objects. The hypothesis is the following: we must use the red objects as building blocks from left to right to construct a path in the output grid, from top to bottom. The path always starts in the top row, in the center of 7 columns. The first red object in the input grid determines what initially happens to the path. Whenever there is a turning in the object to be placed down, then that object is overlaid onto the last tile in the path, instead of directly extending it downwards. Whenever this is no turning in the object to be placed, that object extends directly downward from the last path tile.",
    "c": "We again see an input grid of five red objects, separated by black background tiles. The output grid is a top to bottom path that has been constructed with the usage of these red objects as building blocks from left to right. The hypothesis dictates the rules for the placement of these red objects. Remember that the path always starts in the center column of the 7 column wide output grid, and that tile is colored green. Whenever an object that needs to be placed has a turning in the path, then that object is placed over the last tile in the existing path. Whenever an object that needs to be placed has no turning and is just a straight vertical section, that then object simply extends the last tile in the path. the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid consists of five red objects, each separated by a black background tile. We must use these objects as building blocks to build a path, from left to right. The start of the path is denoted by a green tile in the center of the output grid that is 7 columns wide. Whenever an object that needs to be placed as a turning in the path, then that object is placed over the last tile in the existing path. Whenever an object that needs to be placed has no turning and is just a straight vertical section, then that object simply extends downwards from the last tile in the path. In this case, We start with a vertical straight path from the existing green starting tile. So we extend the path down by two red tiles. the next object to be placed has a turning, which means that we overlay one tile of that red turning object onto the prior last tile in the path. The next object also has a turning, so we overlay that top tile onto the last tile in the path. The 4th object also has a turning, so we overlay the top tile of that object onto the last tile in the path. Finally, for the 5th object, we have no turning in the object, so we simply extend vertically two tiles down the red path from the last existing tile in the path."
