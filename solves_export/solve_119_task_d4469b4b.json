    "a": "Input and output grids are different sizes. The input grid is a 5x5 square and the output grid is a 3x3 square. Input grid has scattered blue tiles on a black background, and the output grid has some gray tiles on a black color background. Because the grids are different sizes, usually the transformation rule has to do with the output grid being an indicator color for some type of selection rule that exists in the content of the input grid. The input grid though really looks like a random assortment of blue and black tiles though, there seems to be no pattern to it that would tell us that the output grid needs to have a gray plus sign on a black color background. Unfortunately we can not create a hypothesis at the moment and will need additional training pairs to help us to construct one.",
    "b": "The input grid is again a 5x5 tile square and the output grid is again a 3x3 square. In this training pair, the input grid has red color tiles on a black color background and the output grid again has gray color tiles on a black color background. The red tiles in the input grid are again seemingly scattered randomly across the input grid. We know that there must be some type of transformation rule that tells us where to place the gray tiles in the output grid. The main problem that we are having in constructing a hypothesis is how to reasonably go from a five by five grid to a three by three grid. Those sizes are not integer multiples of each other, so there can't be any type of mirror or folding, or overlapping construction to produce the selected tiles in the output grid as might be the case for integer multiples. One way to reasonably go from a five by five grid to a three by three grid is to remove two columns and two rows from the input grid and place the remaining tiles next to each other. But then which rows and columns would need to be removed? And then why would the output grid be gray instead of just the same color as the original tiles? Unfortunately again, we don't have a good hypothesis and thus need additional training pairs to arrive at one.",
    "c": "The input grid is again a 5x5 tile square and the output grid is again a 3x3 square. In this training pair, the input grid has green color tiles on a black color background and the output grid again has gray color tiles on a black color background. The gray tiles are oriented in yet a different position in this output grid than any other training pair. Again, the randomness of the green tiles doesn't inform us of anything reasonable that would tell us how to place the gray tiles in the output grid. Depending on how many training pairs are, this might just be a color mapping transformation rule. For example, perhaps the state of the individual tiles and their placements within the input grid has no bearing on the output grid. Perhaps the output grid is just reflecting which non background color exists in the input grid. In order to strengthen this hypothesis, we would need additional training pairs with input grids that contain red, green, or blue tiles and then also have the input grid contain the same gray shaped object in the output grid. This is a very weak hypothesis at this point so let's see more training pairs.",
    "d": "The input grid is again a 5x5 tile square and the output grid is again a 3x3 tile square. The input grid has blue color tiles on a black color background, again with the tiles seemingly randomly scattered in the input grid. The output grid is a gray plus sign on a black color background. According to the weak hypothesis, the output grid is constructed by simply identifying the non-background color that exists in the input grid and using the same gray shaped object that existed in the previous training pairs. For example, in this case the input grid contains blue tiles, and the output grid is a gray plus sign. In the first training pair given, the input grid also contained blue tiles and the output grid was also a gray plus sign shaped object. This significantly strengthens the hypothesis, but we would strengthen it even more with additional red and green input grid tile examples.",
    "e": "The input grid is a 5x5 grid with green tiles and black background color tiles. The output grid is a 3x3 tile grid with gray and black tiles. Since the input grid contains green colored tiles as the non-background color, according to the hypothesis right now, the output grid must contain the symbol that represents the green tiles in the input. In this case, that symbol is a backwards L shape, with the 3x3 grid containing gray tiles on the right and bottom edges, and the rest being the black color background. Because this is what we find in the output grid in this training pair, the hypothesis is strengthened. We will know postiveily state the hypothesis for the first time. Thus the hypothesis is the following. Input grid will contain a 5x5 grid with a black color background and some other number of other colored tiles. Those tiles will be either red, green, or blue. Placement and relative locations of the colored tiles in the input grid have no bearing on the output grid, only the color. Basically, the transformation rule is a selection rule that is determined solely by the non-background color present in the input grid. When that tile color is green, then the output grid needs to be a 3x3 grid with 5 total gray tiles in the right and bottom edges and black tiles in the rest of the output grid. When that tile color is blue, then the output grid needs to be a 3x3 grid with 5 total gray tiles in a plus sign pattern, and the rest of the tiles as black. When that input tile color is red, then the output grid needs to be a 3x3 grid with 5 total gray tiles arranged in a T shape, along the top edge and in the middle column, with the rest of the tiles as black color background.",
    "f": "The input grid is a 5x5 grid with red tiles on a black color background. according to the hypothesis, None of the relative locations of the red tiles matter at all. And the only thing that matters is the identification of the color red for those tiles. In order to construct the output grid, We need to use the appropriate gray symbol in the 3x3 output grid that corresponds to the red tile in the input grid. For red tiles, that symbol is a T shape with the top row of the output grid being gray and the middle column also being gray. The other tiles in the output grid are the black color background. Because this is what we see in the output grid, the hyptohesis holds.",
    "g": "We see immediately that the input grid has red tiles and therefore the output grid should have a T-shaped gray object in it. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid with the appropriate 3x3 size, the hypothesis holds, and we are very confident now in our hypothesis.",
    "h": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid contains green color tiles on a black color background. According to the hypothesis, we need to use the appropriate symbol in the output grid that corresponds to the green tile, regardless of where the green tiles are located in the input grid. the only thing that matters is the green color. From the hypothesis, we know the green color means that the output grid should be a 3x3 grid with a gray backwards L shaped object, where the gray tiles are touching the right and bottom edges of the output grid, and the rest of the tiles in the output grid are the black color background.",
    "i": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid contains blue colored tiles on a black color background. According to the hypothesis, we need to use the appropriate symbol in the output grid that corresponds to the blue tiles, regardless of where the blue tiles are located in the input grid. The only thing that matters is the identification of the blue tiles. From the hypothesis, we know the blue color means that the output grid should be a 3x3 grid with a gray plus sign shaped object in the center, and the rest of the tiles being black color background."
