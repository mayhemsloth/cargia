    "a": "Input and output grids are the same size. Input grid is a 3x3 square with aqua and gray tiles. The output grid is also a 3x3 square with aqua and gray tiles. The input and output grids are very similar to each other, with the exception that it looks like the gray object has moved up one row, with the aqua tiles acting as a background color. This isn't that much information to go off of, so we'll state a weak hypothesis. The input grid will contain a gray object on some color background.  In order to construct the output grid, that gray object moves up one row with respect to its location in the input grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the background color, whatever it is. This is a weak hypothesis and we are definitely interested in more trainign pairs to strengthen this hypothesis.",
    "b": "Input and output grids are again both 3x3 squares. However, this time the input grid has red, yellow, and purple tiles in it, and the input grid contains no gray objects at all. Thus the weak hypothesis is definitely wrong. In this case we notice that the yellow object in the input grid retains the same shape in the outpur grid but is simply rotated by 180 degrees. Looking back at the previous training pair, we now notice that the gray object, instead of being translated up one row, can be described as having been rotated 180 degrees to get to the output grid. Thus the hypothesis is now the following. The input grid will have some shape and some number of colored tiles in it. In order to construct the output grid, we need to rotate the input grid by 180 degrees. The general shapes of the objects will all stay the same, but their relative locations will change with respect to the center, which is exactly what happens when you rotate the entire grid by 180 degrees.",
    "c": "The input grid is a 3x3 square that has purple, red, and green tiles in it. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we simply take the input grid and rotate the contents of it by 180 degrees. This keeps the center tile the same but moves all the other tiles around it, ensuring that the tiles go into there appropriate 180 degree rotated locations. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "Input grid is again a 3x3 square that has red, blue, and aqua tiles in it. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we simply take the input grid tiles and rotate the contents of it by 180 degrees. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid in this pair, the hypothesis holds, and we are now very confident in the hypothesis.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a 3x3 square with pink, yellow, and orange tiles. to the hypothesis in order to construct the output grid which will also be a 3x3 square, we simply take the input grid tiles and rotate the contents of the input grid by 180 degrees. In this case, as one example, the bottom right orange tile in the input grid will therefore go to the top left corner of the output grid. For another example, the yellow L-shaped object in the top right corner of the input grid will go to the bottom left corner of the output grid. Thus the output grid will be a 180 degree rotated version of the input grid."
