    "a": "The input and output grids are the same size, we notice that they are very similar with the exception of one Black background tile being changed to a blue tile. The rule is probably something... figuring out how to determined. which tiles need to be changed, while the rest of the tiles stay the same. Notice in the input grid, there are two blue horizontal tiles. the column that doesn't have a horizontal blue tile, there's a gray tile above it. In the output grid, in the same column where there is a gray tile, and in the same row in which there is blue tiles, the black background tile has been changed to blue. Thus, the hypothesis is the following: In the input grid, there will be blue lines established on a black background. Scattered grey tiles will dictate where the blue line should be extended, in the same row or column in which that gray tile exists. Because of this input and output grid, are pretty small, perhaps this hypothesis will change. but we'll see with additional pairs.",
    "b": "The hypothesis was likely very wrong, and here's why. In the input grid, we notice we have multiple horizontal colored lines and a single gray tile. In the output grid, in the column of this single gray tile, there are now multiple single color tiles in the same rows as the horizontal lines. In the row with the red horizontal line, There is a yellow tile. In the row with a green horizontal line, there is a blue tile. In the row with a blue horizontal line, there is a purple tile. In the row with a purple horizontal line, there is a pink tile. clearly the hypothesis is not filling in the rows below the gray tile with the single tiles similar to the horizontal line color, or else the single tiles would all be the same colors. Instead, they are a variaety of colors. This leads me to believe that these colors correspond to flags or categories. For example, in the first pair, we had... Tiles of blue consisting of the horizontal blue line. Then,  In the column with the gray, we added an additional blue tile. This is likely because blue color signifies the length of the line in the row in which it appears, and specifically blue corresponds to two tiles long. Notice in this pair that we have a green horizontal line with two tiles in it that has a corresponding blue flag. So the new hypothesis is the following in the input grid, we will have multiple different colored horizontal lines that are different than the background color. They will consist of some number of tiles in the line. There will also be a single gray tile somewhere in the grid. The goal is to label, with the color of the single tile flags that appear in the same row as the lines, the number of tiles that appear in the horizontal line in that same row. It seems like if there are two tiles in the line, that corresponds to blue. If there are three tiles, that corresponds to yellow. If there are four tiles, that corresponds to purple. And if there are five tiles, that corresponds to pink.",
    "c": "The input grid has four distinct Horizontal lines in it with a background color of black. We also see the single gray tile that determines the column in which we must put the indicator or flag tiles. The yellow horizontal line has two tiles in it, therefore we need to put a blue tile flag in the same column and row in which that line is. The red horizontal line also has two tiles in it. So we place a blue tile in the same column. of the gray tile and in the same row that the horizontal red line exists. The horizontal orange line contains five tiles in it, And thus, we put a pink tile in the same row as that line and in the same column as the gray tile. The aqua horizontal line has two tiles in it, and thus we need to place a blue indicator tile in the same row as that aqua line and in the same column as the gray tile.",
    "d": "",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. The background is black. There are four horizontal lines of varying colors and a single grey tile. The hypothesis dictates that we must put indicator tiles in the same column of the gray tile and in the same rows as all of the horizontal lines. The color of these indicator tiles is dictated by the relative order of the length of each of the lines. In this case, we see that there are two separate lines, the first and the third, that are both two tiles long. That means these tie for the shortest and therefore get their assigned indicator tile of blue, because blue denotes the shortest. The next shortest is the second line, the horizontal line with three red tiles. This indicator tile color thus must be yellow. The next shortest is the purple line at the bottom with four tiles. This indicator tile must thus be purple. Remember that the indicator tiles are placed in the same column as the single gray tile is and in the same rows as the horizontal lines are. the rest of the input and output grids are the same, including copying over the horizontal lines and the single grey tile, and the rest of the extra black background."
