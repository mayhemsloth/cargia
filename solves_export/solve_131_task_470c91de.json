    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid contains an orange colored background and three non-background colored rectangles. In this case, there's one purple 2x2 square, one blue rectangle, and a larger gray rectangle. We notice that in each of these rectangles, there is exactly one single tile, located in one of the corners of each rectangle, that has been changed from its expected color to aqua. Output grid looks very similar to the input grid with the exception that these objects now do not have their aqua tiles in the corners. Additionally, each of the rectangles have been slightly translated in the output grid compared to the input grid. The purple square which had its aqua tile in the bottom right corner of its object has been moved to down and to the right by one tile. The blue object, which had its aqua tile in the top left corner, has been moved to the left and up in the output grid. The gray object which had its aqua tile in the top right corner in the input grid has been moved to the right and up by one tile in the output grid. It seems like the aqua tile is being used as an indicator tile to tell us which direction these rectangles should move diagonally in the output grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some background color, probably orange, with some number of non-background color rectangles. In each of these rectangles, there will be a single aqua tile in one of the corners of the rectangles. This aqua tile acts as an indicator tile for which direction to diagonally translate that rectangle in the output grid. In order to construct the output grid, each rectangle must be translated in the diagonal direction by one tile indicated by the aqua indicator tile. The aqua indicator tile in each rectangle is also replaced with the expected color of the rectangle in the output grid.",
    "b": "Input grid contains an orange color background with some number of rectangles, as expected. In this case, there is a red square and a pink rectangle. Each of these rectangles contains a single aqua tile in one of its corners. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to move each of these rectangles in the direction indicated by the corner that contains the aqua indicator tile. For example, in this case, the red square will move to the right and up by one tile, and the pink rectangle will move to the left and up by one tile. The aqua indicator tile in the output grid is replaced by the expected color of the rest of the rectangle. Because the output grid contains exactly what we expect it to contain, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid again contains an orange color background with some number of non-background color rectangles. In this case there are three such objects, red purple and green. In each of these rectangles, there is a single corner that has been changed to an aqua colored tile. According to the hypothesis, these aqua tiles act as indicator tiles that tell us in which diagonal direction each of the rectangles should move when constructing the output grid. In the output grid the aqua tiles should also be replaced with the appropriate color of the rest of the rectangle. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be, the hypothesis holds. Note that theno collision happens between the objects on the right of the grid because the movement occurs simultaneously, so the green object is moving out of the way of the purple rectangle at the same time that the purple object would need to occupy those same tiles.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input gradient contains an orange color background with some number of non-background color rectangles. In this case, there are four such rectangles, purple, green, yellow, and red. In each of these rectangles, there is a single corner that has been changed to an aqua-colored tile. According to the hypothesis, this aqua color tile acts as an indicator tile to tell us in which diagonal direction each rectangle should be translated when constructing the output grid. In this case, the purple rectangle has the aqua tile in the bottom right corner, which means the purple rectangle moves down and to the right by one tile. The green rectangle has the aqua tile in the bottom left corner, which means it moves left and down one tile in the output grid. The yellow rectangle has its aqua indicator tile in the top right corner, so it needs to move up and right by one tile. Finally, the red rectangle has its aqua tile in the bottom right corner so it needs to move down and to the right by one tile in the output grid. Additionally, in the output grid, each of the aqua indicator tiles is changed to the appropriate color of the rest of the rectangle."
