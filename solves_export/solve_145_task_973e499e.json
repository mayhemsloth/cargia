    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. The input grid is a 3x3 square, and the output grid is a 9x9 square. We notice that the output grid is itself an integer multiple size of the input grid. That is, you could describe the output grid as a supergrid of 3x3 cells, each containing a 3x3 tile square. This fact is likely helpful in figuring out the transformation rule. The input grid contains aqua and pink tiles. The output grid also contains aqua and pink tiles, as well as black tiles. We notice that if we look at the output grid as a supergrid of 3x3 cells, each consisting of 3x3 tiles, then there are many repeated cell blocks, and they are related to the original input grid. there are only two repeating cell blocks in the output grid. One block is only the pink tiles where the aqua tiles have been replaced with black tiles, and the other cell block is only aqua tiles, where the pink tiles have been replaced by black tiles. What determines which cell blocks need to be one of the two? We notice that the supergrid's cells' locations in the output grid correspond to the location of the aqua tiles themselves in the input grid. That is, this stair-step-like aqua shaped object in the input grid is the same shape as the aqua-only cell blocks in the supergrid in the output grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be some size, probably a 3x3 square. The input grid will contain two colors, probably aqua and pink. The output grid will be a different size as the input grid, corresponding to the size that is made by making a supergrid of the same size as the input grid, using as cells the size of the input grid. In this case, a 3x3 supergrid was made with 3x3 tile squares, becaue the input grid was 3x3 tile square. In order to construct the output grid, we need to populate each of these supergrid cell blocks with one of two options. The first option is all the aqua tiles stay and the pink tiles turn to black color, and the other option is all the pink tiles stay and the aqua tiles turn to black. Which block to use in the supergrid corresponds to the color that is present in that corresponding location of the input grid. Further training pairs will reinforce whether we expect to see the same color or not or whether the input grid size will be different than a 3x3 tile square.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are again different sizes. The input grid is a 3x3 tile square, and the output grid is a 9x9 tile square. Output grid can be viewed as a 3x3 supergrid of cell blocks, each of which are 3x3 tile square. We notice that we have three colors in the input grid, yellow, red, and green in this case, and in the output grid there are those same colors in addition to the black color tiles that are used to fill in the colors of the missing tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to fill in each supergrid cell block with a 3x3 tile square. The exact cell block to choose is determine by the color of the tile that is present in the corresponding location in the input grid. For example, in this case, the top left corner of the input grid has a red tile. This means that the top left supergrid cell block needs to only contain all the red tiles that are originally in the input grid, and the rest of the tiles are replaced with black tiles for that 3x3 square tile section in the output grid. The bottom left corner of the input grid is a green tile, which means that the bottom left corner cell block of the super grid needs to contain a 3x3 tile grid which only the green tiles selected to remain and all other tiles changed to black color. This rule is applied to each of the tiles in the input grid, always corresponding to the supergrid's location and filling in a new 3x3 tile grid in the output grid. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect to see following this construction, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "Input and output grids are again different sizes as expected. The input grid is a 5x5 tile square, and therefore the output grid should be a 25 by 25 tile square, which can be thought of as a 5x5 supergrid of cell blocks, each of which is a 5x5 tile square. The input grid has only blue and aqua tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to fill in each of the supergrid cells in the output grid with only the colored tiles that were present in the corresponding location of the colored tile in the input grid. The rest of the colored tiles in that block would then be changed to black color tiles. That is, each of the tiles in the input grid creates its own cell block in the output grid, of the same size as the input grid. That cell block will be a copy of the input grid but containing only the same colors as that grid tile in the input grid, and all the rest of the colors changed to black. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a 5x5 tile grid, and therefore the output grid should be a 25x25 tiles grid, which can be thought of as a 5x5 supergrid of cell blocks, each of which is a 5x5 tile square. The input grid contains blue, yellow, and red tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we must go through each of the input grid tiles and fill out the corresponding cell location of the supergrid in the output grid with a copy of the input grid, but with only that color tile present and the rest of the tiles changed to black. In this case, there are 13 blue tiles in the input grid, which means there will be 13 supergrids that contain only the blue tiles in the input grid with all the other tiles being black. There are 7 yellow tiles in the input grid, and therefore there will be 7 supergrid cell blocks with only the yellow tiles present in the input grid, and the rest of the tiles in each of those cell blocks will be changed to black. There are five red tiles present in the input grid, and therefore there will be 5 total supergrid cell blocks with only the red tiles present as in the input grid, with the rest of the tiles changed to black.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a 4x4 tile grid. And therefore, the output grid will be a 16 by 16 tile grid, which can be thought of as a 4x4 supergrid of cell blocks, each of which is a 4x4 tile square. The input grid contains green, pink, and yellow tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we must go through each of the input grid tiles and fill out the corresponding location of the supergrid in the output grid with a copy of the input grid, but with only that color tile present and the rest of the colored tiles changed to black color. In this case, there are 8 green tiles in the input grid, and therefore there wil be 8 supergrid cell blocks in the output grid with only green tiles present where they were originally in the input grid. There are 4 pink tiles in the input grid, and therefore there will be 4 supergrid cell blocks where only pink tiles are present and the rest are changed to black tiles. There are 4 yellow tiles in the input grid, and therefore there will be 4 supergrid cell blocks where only the yellow tiles are present and the rest are changed to black tiles."
