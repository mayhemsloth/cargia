    "a": "The input and output grids are the same size. The output grid looks extremely similar to the input grid, but with some of the background color of black changed to aqua or orange. The input grid has a weaving web of grey paths that all interconnect to each other and the edges of theinput grid, with black color background throughout the rest of the grid. The output grid has this same web of gray tiles in the exact location they are in the input grid. However, what has changed is that one of the sections of background has been changed entirely to aqua, and a different has been changed entirely to orange. We don't immediately see any reason to select these two selections to be colored differently, although there must be some property of the input grid that determines which is selected. Upon further inspection, we do notice that the section that has been colored orange is the smallest background color section in the input grid, and the section that is colored with aqua is the largest background section by area in the input grid. So the hypothesis is the following: The input grid will be of some size and contain a black color background and a web of gray interconnected paths. These paths split the input grid into various subsections of background color. In order to construct the output grid, we copy over the input grid exactly as is but with the following changes: the identified smallest by area section is colored in with orange, and the identified largest by area section is colored in with aqua instead of the background color. I would like additional train pairs to further support that this selection rule is correct.",
    "b": "The input grid has a black color background and a network of gray paths that are all interconnected with each other. These paths split the input grid into a variety of different subsections of a black background. According to the hypothesis, we need to first identify which is the smallest and largest subsection of the black background sections. We see in the bottom left corner, there is a subsection that is one tile large, which means it must be the smallest subsection. The largest subsection is on the right side of the grid near the middle. In order to construct the output grid, We copy over the input grid as is to the output grid, with the exception that we need to color in the identified smallest subsection with orange tiles and the largest subsection with aqua tiles. The rest of the input grid stays the same untouched. Because this is what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid again has a black color background and a web network of gray paths that divide the black color background of the input grid into various sized and shaped subsections. According to the hypothesis, we need to first identify the smallest and largest, by area, subsections of the input grid. The smallest subsection is the 2x2 square on the top edge, which has 4 tiles, and the largest subsection is the subsction in the bottom right corner with 23 tiles. In order to construct the output grid, we copy over the input grid to the output grid as is, but then label the smallest subsection as orange with orange tiles instead of the black color background, and label or fill in the largest subsection with aqua tiles. Because this is exactly what the output grid is shown here, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a weblike network of gray paths that divide the black color background of the input grid into a variety of different shapes and sizes of subsections. According to the hypothesis, we need to identify the smallest and the largest subsections by their area. The smallest subsection of black background color is in the top left corner of the input grid, with two total tiles making up the subsection. The largest subsection is on the top edge near the middle, with 10 total tiles in it. In order to construct the output grid, we copy over the input grid to the output grid exactly as is, with the exception that the smallest subsection is labeled with orange and the largest subsection is colored in with aqua tiles instead of the black background color."
