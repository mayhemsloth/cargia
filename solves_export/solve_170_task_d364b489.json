    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid is mostly a black color background with some number of scattered single blue tiles, in this case six. The output grid contains more colors but still has a black color background and those same blue color tiles in the same relative locations. The output grid also contains additional red, pink, aqua, and orange tiles in specific locations. When possible, a single red tile has been added above each blue tile. If this added tile would instead go off the edge of the output grid, it instead does not exist in the output grid. When possible, a single pink tile has been added to the right of each blue tile. When possible, a single orange tile has been added to the left of each blue tile. And finally, when possible, a single aqua tile has been added below each blue tile. Essentially, a multi-colored plus sign has been constructed around each single blue tile as much as possible, where we are naturally restricted to add additional tiles to construct the plus sign by the edge of the output grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be mostly a background color, probably black. There will also be some number of single blue tiles scattered in the input grid, potentially on the edge. In order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively construct a multi-colored plus sign around each of the blue tiles, adding tiles adjacent to the blue center tile when possible. Specifically, one red tile is added above, one pink tile is added to the right, one orange tile is added to the left, and one aqua tile is added below each blue tile. If these additional tiles would otherwise go outside the bounds of the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid, then we simply do not add that tile and the resulting shape is an incomplete plus sign.",
    "b": "The input grid is a mostly black color background with some number of scattered single blue tiles, in this case five. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively turn each single blue tile into a multi-colored plus sign object, adding all the appropriate possible tiles that we can to the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid. The single blue tiles are located in the same location as in the input grid. For each single blue tile, we need to add one red tile above, one pink tile to the right, one orange tile to the left, and one aqua tile below the blue tile. If the added tiles would otherwise fall outside the edges of the output grid, we do not add it and simply end up with an incomplete plus sign object. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a mostly black color background with some number of scattered single blue tiles in this case seven. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively change each single blue tile into a multi-colored plus sign object by adding all the appropriate possible tiles that we can to the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid. The single blue tiles are located in the same location as in the input grid. For each single blue tile, we need to add one red tile above, one pink tile to the right, one orange tile to the left, and one aqua tile below the blue tile. If the added tiles would otherwise fall outside the edges of the output grid, we do not add it and simply end up with an incomplete plus sign object. In this case, we will have three total complete multi-color plus sign objects, and four total incomplete plus sign objects."
