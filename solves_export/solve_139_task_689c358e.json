    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid contains an orange color background and a single pink color tile layer on the edge of the input grid. There are also four individual cross like objects oriented in different directions in the orange section. There's a purple, aqua, red, and gray object. These are cross-like objects and not plus signs because one of the legs or diections has an additional tile to it, which breaks the symmetry of the plus sign like object and makes it into a cross like object that has an orientation. Output grid looks very similar to the input grid and still contains an orange color background and the four cross objects in the same locations. However the pink outer layer no longer contains just pink tiles but contains black tiles and also tiles of the colors of the objects. We notice that all the non-pink colored tiles on the outer edge are always in line with the longer line of any of the cross objects. Specifically, the black tile on the edge seems to appear in the same row or column as the longer side of the cross and also on the same side as the extra tile that has been added. The colored tile on the pink edge appeas in the same row or column as the longer side of the cross and on the opposite side of black tile, and is the same color as the object itself. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some color background, proabably orange, and the outer edge will be a different color, likely pink like in this case. The interior will contain some number of cross like objects in different orientations and of various colors. In order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is to the output grid with the exception of changing some specific tiles on the edge layer. For each cross object, we must identify the axis that is the longer one, and then change the two tiles on the edge that are in that same row or column. One tile must be changed to black, and we identify which is which because the black tile is on the side of the cross that has a longer piece of the longer line. The other tile on the opposite edge in the same row or column must be change from the color pink to the same color as the cross object. After doing that for each cross object, the output grid is done.",
    "b": "The input grid contains an orange color background and a pink single tile outer layer. As expected, there are various number of cross-like objects in the input grid of different colors and orientations, in this case four: aqua, gray, purple and red. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we must copy over the input grid as is to the output grid with the exception of changing some number of tiles in the pink outer layer. For each cross object we must identify the axis that is the longer one and then change the two tiles on the edge that are in that same row or column as the longer line of the cross. One tile must be changed to black, and for each cross object we know which one to change to black because it is on the same side as the longer piece of the longer line of the cross object. For example, in this case, the aqua and gray objects have their vertical longer pieces on the lower side, and thus there are two black tiles, one from each of these objects, on the bottom edge of the output grid. For each object, we need to change two tiles in the pink outer layer, and the other tile is on the opposite edge as the black tile. The other tile is the same color as the color of the cross object that is producing this pair of changed color tiles. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid for each object, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains an orange color background and the pink single tile outer layer on the edge of the input grid. It also contains various number of cross-like objects of different colors and orientations. In this case, there are four cross objects, one gray, one red, one purple and one aqua. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to copy over the input grid as is, with the exception of changing some number of tiles in the pink outer layer of the output grid. For each cross object, we need to identify the longer line that makes up that object. In this case, the gray object, red object, and purple object all have longer vertical lines, and the aqua object has a longer horizontal line. Next we need to change the two tiles on the pink edge layer that are in the same row or column as the longer line of the cross. One tile must be changed to black, and that tile is the one on the same side of the cross that has the longer piece of the longer line of the cross. The other tile must be changed to the color of the object and will be on the total opposite edge in the same row or column as the black tile. In this case, there will be 8 total tiles changed from pink in the outer edge layer because there are 4 total cross objects."
