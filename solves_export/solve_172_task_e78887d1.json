    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. The input grid is 15 tiles wide and 5 tiles tall, while the output grid is 15 tiles wide and 3 tiles tall. The input grid contains a black color background with four spaced, different colored and different shaped objects, all of which can fit within a 3x3 bounding box. From left to right, there is a red object, then green object, then blue object, and then gray object. The output grid has eliminated the top and bottom rows of the fully black color background tiles. There are still four spaced, different colored and different shaped objects, and the colors of each object is in the same relative place. However, the shapes of each object has changed relative position and thus effectively been recolored. For example, in the input grid there was a green L shaped object in the second slot from the left. In the output grid, there is now an L shaped red object in the first slot, all the way on the left. The shape of the object moved to the left, but the object itself was recolored to the color that was belonging to that slot originally, which was red in the input grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a background color, probably black. It will also contain some number of equally spaced, single colored, differently shaped objects that all can be contained within some size bounding box. These single colored objects should be thought of as occupying one of some number of slots, in this case it was four slots but it could be more or less than that. In order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively cycle the shapes of the object in each slot to the left by one position, while keeping the colors affixed to the same slot location. The shape in the leftmost slot will circle around to occupy the rightmost slot. Additionally, the output grid will contain only the number of tiles necessary to encase the height of all of the objects.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are again different sizes. The input grid is 11 tiles wide and 9 tiles tall, while the output grid is 11 tiles wide and 3 tiles tall. The input grid contains a black color background and six spaced, different colored and different shaped objects, all of which can fit within a 3x3 tile bounding box. The objects are arranged in two rows and three columns. According to the hypothesis, we need to think of these spaces as slots, where each color will stay the same in each slot but the object shape will change. The previous hypothesis stated that there would be a single line or row of objects, but in the input grid there are two rows of objects. However, we see that the input grid is simply showing us one iteration of applying the cycling movement rule that has been described in the hypothesis. For example, in the top row of three objects, we see that the colors are red, green, and then blue from left to right. The bottom row also has red, green, and blue in that same order, as well as the output grid has red, green, and blue objects. Thus the colors of the slots are red, green, and then blue. We notice in the input grid in the first row there's a T shape object in the last slot, and then in the next row that shaped object is now one slot to the left, in the middle. The output grid then shows the T shaped object in the left most slot, which demonstrates that correctly described shape movement cycling iteration needs to continue as part of the output grid, and the input grid is showing us one such example. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect to see according to the hypothesis, the hypothesis holds. Additionally, we now know why the output grid is a different size as the input grid. The input grid can contain an arbitrary number of examples of the object slot movements, but the output grid just needs to show the next such iteration applied to the last shown row in the input grid.",
    "c": "The input grid contains a mostly black color background, with two rows of different shaped and single colored objects, all of which can be contained in a 3x3 bounding box. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to apply a single iteration of the cycle movement rule onto the last row of objects present in the input grid. The output grid should only be large enough to contain the objects present, and not any larger. According to this rule, each of the objects can be thought of as occupying a slot, and the shapes of the objects move to the left but the colors of those shapes will stay in the same relative location in that slot. If an object is on the leftmost slot, then it will cycle back to the rightmost slot. In this case, the left most slot is red, the next slot is green, the next is blue, and the right most slot is gray. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect, the hypothesis holds.",

    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input graded contains a mostly black colored background with two rows of different shaped and single colored objects, each of which can be contained in a 3x3 bounding box.

In this case, the leftmost slot is the color red, then the next slot is green, then the next slot is blue, and then finally the rightmost slot will be the color gray. In this case, there are two rows of objects in the input grid, so we apply the cycle movement rule onto the last bottom row of the objects. In this case, the output grid should be 15 tiles wide and 3 tiles tall."
