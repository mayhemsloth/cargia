    "a": "The input and output grids are the same size. The input grid is a 6x6 tile square with a mostly black color background and two single colored tiles, one green and one aqua. The output grid has those single color tiles in the same spots, but with additional green tiles. These additional green tiles seem to have grown from the single green tile in the direction of the aqua tile that was in the same row as it, and then when this growing green line encountered the aqua tile, it changed direction up until it hit the output grid edge. It's unclear why the green tiles went up instead of down, so perhaps we should see more training pairs before making a hypothesis. Perhaps the color of the tile itself determines which direction the path should turn? When we do make a hypothesis, we do know that it likely involves single green tiles that grow until they hit an aqua tile and then change directions after that.",
    "b": "Input and output grids are again the same size. The input grid is a mostly black color background with three single colored tiles, one green, one aqua, and one pink. The green tile is in the same row as the pink tile. The output grid has all of these single color tiles in the exact locations with additional green tiles that now make a winding path. These additional green tiles seem to have grown from the single green tile in the direction of the pink tile. The green path then turned in the direction of the aqua tile after hitting the pink tile and then continued down until hitting the aqua tile, at which point it turned left and continued until hitting the edge of the output grid. In both this training pair and the previous training pair, when the green path would encounter the aqua tile, the path then turned left with respect to the direction that it was coming from. A different way to put it is that the direction was 90 degrees counterclockwise. In the output grid of this training pair, we see a pink tile that the green path had hit, and at that point it turned right, or 90 degrees clockwise, and then continued. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be mostly a background color, probably black. There will also be a single green tile and some number of scattered single pink and aqua tiles. One of these scattered tiles will be in the same row and column as the green tile. In order to construct the output grid, we must effectively grow a green path out from teh single green tile and then turn directions when encountering or hitting the other tiles. When encountering a pink tile, the green path should then turn 90 degrees clockwise. When encountering an aqua tile, the green path should turn 90 degrees counterclockwise and continue on. This pattern continues until the green path hits the edge of the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid, and the green line stops growing at that point.",
    "c": "The input grid is mostly a black color background with one green tile, two pink tiles, and one aqua tile. The green tile is in the same row as one of the pink tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively grow this green tile into a green path, while turning in the correct directions when the green path encounters the single tiles in the input grid. In this case, the green path will encounter a pink tile first, which will then turn it 90 degrees clockwise, and then an aqua tile, which will turn the green path 90 degrees counterclockwise, and then another pink tile, which will turn the green path 90 degrees clockwise, finally ending up hitting the bottom edge of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is exactly the same as the input grid with the exception of this new winding green path. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",

At any aqua tile encountered, the green path should turn 90 degrees counterclockwise, and at ay pink tile encountered, the green path should turn 90 degrees clockwise. The green path encounters another aqua tile, then pink, then aqua, and then one more pink tile. The green path will finally hit the right edge of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid with the exception of this new grown green winding path."
