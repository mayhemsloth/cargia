    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid is entirely black tiles. There are no other tile colors existing in the input grid. This lack of color information must mean that the exact size of the input grid has something to do with how we construct the output grid. In this case, the input grid is a 5x5 tile square. The output grid is also a 5x5 tile square and is now mostly blue colors, but has 4 black tiles remaining. It's hard to construct a hypothesis from this information alone, but the output grid pattern must be affected by the size of the input grid. So let's see another training pair and then we can make a better informed hypothesis.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are again the same sizes, but this time they are both 7x7 tile squares. Again, as expected, the input grid is entirely black tiles and there are no other tile colors existing in the input grid. The output grid is again a mostly blue color but has a pattern of remaining black tiles. From both training pairs we've seen so far, it seems like the output pattern is made by changing every other row and every other column to blue tiles. For example, the first, third, fifth, and seventh rows are all blue and also the first, third, fifth, and seventh columns are also all blue in the output grid. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be entirely a single color of tiles, probably black. It will likely be a square of some odd integer size, but could also be a rectangle of two different odd integers.  In order to construct the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid, we simply change every other row and column to blue tiles, starting with the first. Depending on the size of the input grid there will be some remaining black tiles that are not part of any odd number of column or row.",
    "c": "The input grid is a 9x9 tile square with only black color tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we simply copy over the input grid as is and then change every other row and column into blue tiles, starting with the first row and column. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We applied the hypothesis here. The input grid is an 11x11 tile square with only black tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we simply copy over the input grid as is and then change every other row and column into blue tiles, starting with the first row and column. In this case, the output grid will be an 11 by 11 tile square, where the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh column and row are all filled with blue tiles, and the rest of the output grid remains black tiles."
