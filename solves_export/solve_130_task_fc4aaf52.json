    "a": "Input grid and output grid are the same sizes. The input grid contains an aqua color background with a multicolored object that happens to havea horizontal axis of symmetry. The object has a gray tile interior with a single layer of black tiles on the exterior. The output grid also has an aqua color background and a similar shaped objects, but now the two colors have been swapped in the multicolored object, and the top symmetric part of the object has been translated by three tiles to the right. It's unclear why exactly it is three tiles, but perhaps it is because that's the size of the mirror edge, so the top half is translated enough to be fully not directly adjacent to the bottom half anymore, which stays in the same place. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a background color, probably aqua, along with some multicolored object that has an axis of symmetry. In order to construct the output grid, we need to identify that axis of symmetry, and then split the object along that axis, moving it some number of tiles, as determined by the object shape itself, away from bottom half of the object. Additionally, the two colors that make up the multicolored object need to be swapped. Note that we are not confident in this hypothesis because it is still unclear which direction we need to translate the half of the object, and why the top half was chosen, or how many tiles to actually move it. More training pairs will be useful to strengthen the hypothesis.",
    "b": "The input grid contains an aqua colored background and a multicolored object. This multi-color object has a red interior and a blue exterior. The multicolored object also contains an axis of symmetry along its horizontal middle. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to slice this object along its horizontal axis of symmetry and translate the top half to the right some number of tiles. The bottom half stays in the same location as in the input grid, but both the top and bottom half of the multicolored object has their colors swapped. In this case, the interior will be blue and the exterior will be red in the output grid. According to the hypothesis, we need to translate the top half of the object to the right the number of tiles that the object is wide at the mirror symmetry edge. In this case, the object is five tiles wide at that point, so the top half of the object should be moved 5 tiles to the right. Because this description is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds. We are now more confident that the translation tile number is determined by the shape itself, and that we expect the axis of symmetry to be along the horizontal axis.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. Input grid contains an aqua-colored background and a multi-colored object. In this case, the object has a purple interior with a single exterior layer of yellow tiles. The multicolored object also contains a horizontal axis of symmetry, as expected. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to slice this object along its horizontal axis of symmetry and translate the top half to the right by a number of tiles determined by the width of the object at the axis of symmetry. In this case, the object is 7 tiles wide, so the top half of the object should be translated to the right by 7 tiles in the output grid, with the bottom half staying in the same location that it started in the input grid. In the output grid, both the bottom half and the translated top half of the object need to have their colors swapped as well. In this case, the interior of the multicolored object should now be yellow in the output grid, and the exterior tiles should now be purple in the output grid."
