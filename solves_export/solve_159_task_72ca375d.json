    "a": "The input and output grids are drastically different sizes. The output grid is a 2x2 square and the input grid is a 10x10 square. Usually when this type of large size discrepancy occurs, it means we have some type of selection rule being applied to the input grid to determine the output grid. The input grid contains a black color background and some number of objects of different sizes and colors. In this case, we have a yellow object, an aqua object, and a red object.  We notice that the output grid contains entirely only yellow tiles and specifically a 2x2 tile square, which is the exact object shape as the yellow object in the input grid. Therefore, we suspect that the selection rule, whatever it is, selected the yellow object in this training pair.  We notice that the yellow object in this case is the smallest object in the input grid, so that could be the selection rule. However, just as likely, it could be that we always select the yellow object, or the object with some symmetry, or the object located in the top left corner of the input grid. We cannot form a solid hypothesis yet without more training pairs, but we at least know that we need to use a selection rule to select one of the objects. Let's see more training pairs before stating a hypothesis.",
    "b": "Input and output grids are again drastically different sizes. The output grid is a 2 row by 4 column grid, and the input grid is a 10x10 tile square. The input grid contains a black color background and some number of different color and sized objects. In this case, there's a red object, an orange object, and a pink object. We did not have a hypothesis yet with one training pair but we know that we must have some selection rule that tells us which object to select and have that be the entirety of the output grid. In this case, the output grid is the pink object, along with two additional tiles of black color background that is used to fill out the bounding box that would fully contain the pink object. So why was the pink object selected by the selection rule in this case? In the first training pair, we didn't know what the selection rule was, but we gave a variety of different options. The yellow square was the smallest object, so perhaps that is why it was selected. However, the pink object in this case is not the smallest and therefore that can't be the selection rule. The yellow object was yellow and therefore perhaps we always choose the yellow object. However, the pink object is not yellow and there is no yellow object in the input grid, and therefore that proposed selection rule must be wrong. We also proposed that perhaps the object located in the top left corner of the input grid is always selected. However in this case then the red object would have been selected, and that is not the case, so that must be wrong. We also proposed that perhaps the object needed to have some sort of symmetry associated with it, like horizontal or vertical symmetry, because the yellow square was the only shape with symmetry in the first input grid and that was chosen. We see here that the pink object in this training pair is also the only one with some symmetry, in this case horizontal symmetry. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a background color, probably black, and some number of different single-colored objects. In order to construct the output grid, we need to apply the selection rule and select the single colored object that contains some type of symmetry, either horizontal or vertical symmetry. Then the output grid is simply a copy of the bounding box that entirely contains this single colored object, so the output should contain only this object's colored tiles and perhaps the background colored tiles as well, to fill in the potential gaps that exist in the bounding box of that object.",
    "c": "The input grid contains a black color background and three single colored objects of different shapes. There's a green object, a gray object, and an aqua object. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to apply the selection rule to select the single object that contains some type of symmetry. We see in the input grid that the gray object is the only one that exhibits horizontal symmetry, and therefore the gray object will be selected. The output grid should thus be a copy of the bounding box of tiles that entirely contain the gray object. In this case, it is a 2 row tall and 4 column wide tile rectangle, with two black background tiles placed appropriately in the output grid along with a copy of the gray object. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grade that the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a black color background and three single colored objects of different shapes. There's a purple object, a green object, and a yellow object. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to apply the selection rule to select the single object that contains some type of symmetry. We see in the input grid that the purple object is the only one that exhibits horizontal symmetry. Therefore the purple object is selected by the selection rule. The output grid should therefore be a copy of the bounding box of tiles that entirely contain the purple object. In this case that will be a 3 tile tall by 4 tile wide rectangle, with 4 black color background tiles appropriately placed along with a copy of the purple object in the output grid."
