    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes, So we are likely selecting or organizing some subset of the input grid and putting that as the output grid. In this case, we notice a large aqua background with various different overlapping rectangle objects in the input grid. the largest of which is a red rectangle. Next largest is a green rectangle and smallest a 2x2 square is a gray square. It seems like the output grid has each of these overlapping rectangles. aligned with the top left corner. where the smallest is laying on top of. the next largest, and then the next largest. The hypothesis for the rule is that we must collect and identify the different rectangles. that are present in the input grid against some color background. place them down into the output grid whose Size is determined by the largest of those rectangles. that are identified in the input grid. Then we effectively stack, or cover, the largest with the next largest, aligning the rectangles in successsion in the top left corner of the output grid.",
    "b": "Again, we identify an input grid with a background color, which is yellow in this case. We see a red. object That is 8x6 and a blue rectangle that's on top of it that is 5x5 with a green rectangle that is 4x2. because the red rectangle which in this case is partially occluded by the blue square rectangle, is the largest object that sets the size for the output grid. We then collect the rest of the objects. in size order. and lay them down on top of this red rectangle in the output grid. The next rectangle is blue. And we color the corresponding tiles in the output grid as blue. That needs to be placed is the green rectangle, which then changes some of the colors of the blue tiles in the output grid.",
    "c": "The input grid has a background color of black. There are four objects. There's an 8x8 pink square. And then a five by five yellow square that is included partially by the pink square. and the pink square is partially occluded by the 3x4 green rectangle. There's also a 2x1 aqua rectangle. According to the hypothesis, we start with the largest one, which is a 8 by 8 pink square which dictates the output grid's size. The yellow square 5x5 object then gets placed on top of the ink square in the output grid. which includes some of the pink in the output grid. The next largest rectangle object is the green one, which then aligns in the top left corner and includes some of the yellow. Finally, the next largest, which is the 2x1 aqua object, gets placed in the top left corner on top of the green object to arrive at the final output grid.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. We identify the input grid as having a blue background with four objects. There's a red rectangle that is 10 by 6 which is partially occluded by a green 4x4 square. There's also a 2x3 aqua rectangle and a 2x1 purple rectangle. The output grid is dictated by the largest of these objects, which is the red rectangle that is 10 columns wide and 6 rows tall. Thus, we start the output grid with a fully red 10x6 rectangle. However, we then need to place on top in size order the rest of the objects. The next largest object is the 4x4 green square, which is aligned in the top left corner of the output grid, effectively changing some of the output grid values to green. The next largest object is the 2x3 aqua rectangle, which is also aligned in the top left corner of the output grid and effectively occludes some of the green rectangle. The next largest object is... The purple 2x1 rectangle, which is, as the hypothesis goes, placed  in the top left corner of the output grid, effectively occluding some of the aqua rectangle."
