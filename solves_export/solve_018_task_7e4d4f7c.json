    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes, although the Number of columns are the same. The rows are different. Seems like we have a standard black background input grid. a checkerboard-like orange tiling. In the output grid, we have the same orange tiling across the top and one row, and then pink tiling along the bottom. There must be some rule. or logic. that involves how many number of orange tiles there are that dictates what size the output grid should be. I'm not confident enough to make a hypothesis right now, so let's go to the next pair for more information.",
    "b": "In this pair, the background color is red. and there's a blue checkerboard-like pattern on the top edge of the input grid and an Orange checkered board like a pattern on the left edge of the input grid. Notice that in the output grid there's one single orange on the left And the blues on the top are copied over. And then we have pink. Piles that reflect. almost over this single row of orange. I'm still not sure how the other rows with orange tiles at the beginning of them Contribute to the puzzle, but maybe they're just a red herring and they don't really do much for you. They may be spurious information. My hypothesis right now is that You have some large input grid with some background color. the top edge is filled with scattered Tiles of other colors and then on the left You have a single orange tile that denotes the first row over which you mirror the top edge, And those corresponding tiles are then labeled with pink. background color is the same as the input grid. Not very confident with this hypothesis though, so we'll see what the next pair brings.",
    "c": "And this pair of the background color is yellow. the top edge scattered tiles is And the side is. The solution seems to just be. that you copy the top row and the second from top row, and then duplicate the top row as the third row with the exception that you need to change the corresponding non-background color tiles in the top row into pink for the third row.",
    "d": "Again, we see an input grid with a background color of purple this time. The top row has scattered yellow tiles in them. The second row has an orange tile in the first column. Following the hypothesis, we duplicate these two rows, and then simply copy the top row for the third row with the exception that the non-background colored tiles are all changed to pink. The rest of the information in the input grid is useless past the top two rows.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. We identify the background color as blue and the top row as scattered aqua tiles. the second row is copied as is to the output. Just like the first row. The third row in the output will be a copied version of the topmost row, but with the non-background color tiles, which in this case is aqua, turned into pink tiles. And that's it."
