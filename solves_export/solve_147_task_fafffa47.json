    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. The input grid is three columns by six rows, and the output grid is a 3x3 tile square. The Input grid as a black color background with some purple tiles in the top half and some blue tiles in the bottom half. Note that the top half and bottom half of the input grid is exactly the same size as the output grid, a 3x3 tile square. This fact points to a probable overlapping construction or comparison between thetop half and the bottom half of the input grid to get us to the output grid. The output grid contains black color background and two red tiles. We notice that the location of the tiles in the output grid that are red tiles are both black in both of the top half and bottom half subsections of the input grid. Note that for every other relative location, this is not true. At least one of the top half or bottom half subsections has a non-black color tile represented. This points to the output grid being a type of binary operation, a not or, or nor of the two equal sized subsections in the input grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a black color background with two equal sized subsections, where the subsections are probably 3x3 tile square stacked on top of each other. Each subsection will contain either black tiles or some other color tiles. In order to construct the output grid, We need to overlay the top subsection and the bottom subsection and align the relative locations of the tiles and then perform a not or operation. That is, we need to identify where, in this overlaid construction, neither of the non-background color tiles are present. Only those exact tiles will be labeled as red in the output grid, and all other tiles will be labeled with the black background color. In this case, only the top row middle column and the bottom left corner tile will be labeled as red, because all other tiles have present either a purple tile or a blue tile, or both. This operation is the not or, or simply nor, logical operation.",
    "b": "As expected, the input grid and output grids are different sizes. The input grid is again three columns wide and six rows tall. The top subsection of the input grid has purple tiles, and the bottom subsection has the blue tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to first make an overlaid construction of the top half and the bottom half, and then perform a NOR operation on this overlaid construction. That is, the tiles that have neither a single purple or single blue tile located in the relative locations after overlaying on top of each other are selected to be represented as red tiles in the output grid. All other tiles will be the black background color. In this case, there are only two such tiles, both in the middle column of the output grid. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be, the hypothesis holds.",

All other tiles in the output grid that have at least one non-background color tile present will be labeled with the background color in the output grid. In this case, there are exactly five such tiles that need to be labeled with red. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be, the hypothesis holds.",

    "e": "Input grid is exactly what we expect it to be, a three column wide and six column tall input grid with purple tiles in the top half and blue tiles in the bottom half. The hypothesis is very strongly held up right now, and this training pair further improves our confidence in the hypothesis that we need to do a NOR operation using the top half of the input grid with the bottom half of the input grid. Because the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be if the hypothesis holds.",
    "f": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid is a three column wide and six row tall grid which can be thought of as two 3x3 tile square subsections. The top half has purple tiles and black color background, while the bottom half has blue tiles and black color background. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, which will be a 3x3 tile square, we need to first make an overlaid construction of the top half subsection and the bottom half subsection. Then we need to be perform a not or logical operation on the non-background colors of this overlaid construction. Wherever there is at least one single purple or blue tile in the overlay construction, the corresponding relative location in the output grid has the black color background tile. Wherever there is neither a blue tile nor a purple tile present, then that relative tile location is labeled with a red tile in the output grid. In this case, there are exactly two such red tiles in the output grid."
