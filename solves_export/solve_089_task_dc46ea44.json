    "a": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid contains a horizontal yellow line on an orange color background, dividing the input grid into a top half and bottom half. There are also two objects, one red and one pink, on the bottom half of the input grid. The output grid contains this same horizontal yellow line in the same place on the orange colro background, but now the two objects that were in the bottom half of the input grid have seemed to move into the top half section of the output grid, in some specific location. It seems like in the output grid, these two shapes are forming a continuous path. So perhaps the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a horizontal line that splits up the input grid into a top half and a bottom half. In the bottom half, there will be some number of objects of different colored objects. In order to construct the output grid, we need to move these objects into the top half of the output grid, in a specific way. I'm not confident with only one training example, but the hypothesis currently is that we place the furthest right most object into the top right corner, and then construct a winding path that is trying to reach to the left edge of the output grid. Thus for every object in the bottom of the input grid, we place the next such object on top of the last tile in the previous object. In this case, there are only two such objects, so the red object would overlap the left most ending tile of the purple object or path. I'm not confident in this hypothesis, but there must be some type of rule that dictates the exact location or order of placement of the objects in the bottom half of the input grid. We will need more training pairs to be more confident in the answer.",
    "b": "The input grid, again, it contains a horizontal yellow line and an orange color background. we again see a pink shape in the bottom half of the input grid with another colored shape, in this case red. According to the hypothesis, we would need to place this rightmost object into the top right corner. But we see that is not the case in this output grid, so our hypothesis up to this point must be wrong. We notice instead that in both pairs the pink shaped object is in the exact columns in the top half and bottom half of the pairs, and they have simply moved up above the yellow line and placed at the top edge of the output grid. We also notice now that this pink object looks similar to a hook, and the horizontal line could represent the surface of water. Basically this looks like we are \"hooking\" the other object that is floating in the water below the \"surface\" of the yellow line, so this is effectively a symbolic representation of the act of fishing! The new hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a horizontal line that splits the input grid into two separate sections, a top half and a bottom half. The bottom half will contain a pink hook shape and a different shape. In order to construct the output grid, This pink hook shape is put into the same column at the top edge of the output grid. The other shape, in this case the aqua square, is then effectively hooked on the last tile of the pink hook shape, and thus needs to be moved such that its bottom right tile is placed onto the end of the hook, covering up one of the pink tiles in the hook shape.",
    "c": "The input grid contains a horizontal yellow line on an orange color background. We see a pink hook shape in some columns of the input grid in the bottom half, as well as an additional shape, in this case made of blue tiles. According to the hypothesis, we are symoblically representing the act of fishing, so we need to move this pink hook shape up to the top edge of the output grid, while also hooking the other object onto the end of the hook shape. The previous hypothesis said that we needed to overlap the hooked shape onto the hook and thus change one of the pink tiles to the color of the object color, but in this training pair there is no bottom right tile that exists in that object. Thus, instead, it seems like we place the object on top of the end of the hook this time. It would be nice to have additional training pairs to further suppport the hypothesis of how the objects are hooked onto the hook, but otherwise the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a horizontal yellow line on an orange color background. In the bottom half of the input grid, there is a pink hook shape, and a different color object, in this case, aqua. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, this pink hook shape needs to be moved to the top edge of the output grid, in the same columns that it started in, along with the aqua object which has been hooked by the hook. In this case, the aqua object has a valid tile in the bottom right corner of its object, so we assume that we place that bottom right corner tile over the last tile of the pink hook, and that location determines the relative location of the rest of the aqua object."
