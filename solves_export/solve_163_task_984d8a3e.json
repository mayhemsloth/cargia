    "a": "The input and output grids are the same size. The input grid contains three different colors that can be considered three different sections of the input grid. There's a blue section on the left, a green section in the middle, and a black section on the right. The boundaries between these sections are not well defined and are seemingly randomly jagged. The boundaries between the green and blue sections are also not the same shape as the boundary between the green and black sections. The output grid looks somewhat similar and also contains only blue, green, and black tiles. However, now there is not a single well-defined blue section as some of the blue tiles have effectively moved across their rows and into some of the green section space to occupy it. All of the black tiles are in the exact location and no new black tiles have appeared nor disappeared in the output grid. How do we know how many blue tiles need to be moved to the right from each row? If we view the the green section as empty space, then we can describe what's happening as the blue tiles are moving into and filling the empty spaces of the jagged black section, in such a way that the blue tiles only fill in up to the furthest distance that the black section originally goes. Put another way, it seems that for each row, we move over any available blue tiles up until the combined number of black and blue tiles in that row reach the maximum number of black tiles, which in this case is four. If we don't have enough blue tiles in that row from the blue section, we simply use all of them. If we have more than enough blue tiles in that row, we use only the amount needed and leave the rest of the blue tiles in their place. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain three different color sections, arranged from left to right, blue, green, and black. We can consider the green as empty space. The boundaries between each section will be jagged. In order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively move the appropriate number of blue tiles to fill in the holes that are created in the black section, on a per row basis, only up the maximum number needed. The maximum number is determined by the maximum row length of the original black section. For each row, if there are more blue tiles than needed, we leave behind whatever blue tiles we do not use. If there are fewer blue tiles than needed, we move all of the blue tiles in that row.",
    "b": "The input grid again contains three different colors that can be considered three different sections of the input grid. There's a green section on the left, an orange section in the middle, and a purple section on the right. The boundaries between these sections are not well defined and are seemingly randomly jagged. According to the hypothesis, we expected blue, green, and black sections, but with this training pair, we now know that we have to consider the sections in a more generic color agnostic way and identify them on a per pair basis based on their relative location. In this case, the orange is the middle section and should be considered as empty space. The green section is on the left and thus should be considered as the tiles to be moved and the purple section on the right is the determining section to be filled in. In order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively move the appropriate number of left section tiles, in this case green, to fill in the holes that are created in the right section tiles, on a per row basis. In this case, the maximum number of tiles should be four because the purple section has the maximum row of four tiles, for each row. If there are any green tiles, we move over up to four, such that the total number of green and purple tiles will be up to a maximum of 4. If there are more than four green tiles, we leave the remaining behind. Because this is exactly what we expect in the output grid, the hypothesis holds with the exception that we need to identify the sections instead of assuming that each section will be the same color from training pair to training pair.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains three different colors that can be considered three different sections of the input grid. There's a gray section on the left an orange section in the middle and a pink section on the right The boundaries between these sections are not well defined and are seemingly randomly jagged. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively move the appropriate number of left section tiles in this case gray to fill in the holes that are created in the right section tiles in this case pink on a per row basis. The orange middle section can be considered as empty space. Specifically, the maximum number of tiles total after moving the gray tiles for each row will be the maximum tile length of the longest original pink rows. In this case, the longest tile length is 8 pink tiles, which sets the maximum tile length at 8. Therefore for each row, we need to move over gray tiles from the left to the right until there are either 8 total gray and pink tiles on the right or there are no remaining gray tiles to be moved to the right. For any row that already has 8 pink tiles in it, we do not move over any gray tiles in that row."
