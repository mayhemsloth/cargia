    "a": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid is a 3x3 grid with all green tiles. There is really not much information in the input grid to tell us anything. The output grid's first row has all gray tiles, and then the rest is black tiles. The output grid also does not contain that much information. Because of the lack of information in the input and output grids, we should move on to the next training pair to see if we can get additional information about what the transformation rule is. Note that the input grid being a single color might mean that the input grid is simply an indicator tile place holder and we just need to learn the mapping of the color to the output grid's shape for that indicator color. We will see with more training pairs.",
    "b": "Input grid and output grids are again three by three squares. The input grid, in this case, contains green tiles on the top row, and then yellow and red l-shaped tiles in the other two rows. The output grid contains black colored tiles with a diagonal gray line that starts in the top left and goes to the bottom left of the output grid's 3x3 square. This training pair again does not hold that much information, and is even more confusing at this point. Clearly there must be some type of rule that tells us where the gray tiles need to be placed in the output grid. There have only been three gray tiles in each of the output grids so far, so perhaps the location of the gray tiles means something about the colors in the input grid. We will need more training pairs to form a solid hypothesis.",
    "c": "Input grid and output grids are again 3x3 squares. The input grid is entirely yellow tiles, and the output grid has the entire first row as gray tiles with the rest as black tiles. We note that this output grid is identical to the first training pair, which had its input grid entirely one color. Perhaps the output grid is simply a type of counter for how many colors exist anywhere in the input grid. We still don't have a solid hypothesis, so we want more training pairs to form a better hypothesis.",
    "d": "Input and output grids are again 3x3 squares. In this case, the input grid has yellow tiles on the top two rows and green tiles on the bottom row. The output grid in this case is a gray diagonal line going from the top left to the bottom right, with black tiles filling in the rest of the output grid. Because the input grid has exactly two different colors in it and the output grid is a now a new type of pattern, we should make a hypothesis that involves the number of unique colors in the input grid. Thus hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be a 3x3 grid containing some number of colored tiles, in some arrangement. Regardless of how the tiles are placed, we simply count the number of unique colors that exist in the input grid. If there is exactly one color, then the output grid needs to be a 3x3 square with 3 gray tiles in the first row, the topmost row, and the rest of the output grid as black tiles. If there is exactly two colors represented in the input grid, then the output grid needs to be a 3x3 square with a gray diagonal line going from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the output grid. The rest of the output grid will be black tiles. If there is exactly three colors represented in the input grid, then the output grid needs to be a 3x3 square with a gray diagonal line going from the top right corner to the bottom left corner of the output grid. The rest of the output grid will be in black tiles. In essence, the output grid is simply a symbol representing how many number of unique colors are shown in the input grid.",
    "e": "Input grid is a 3x3 square with red and green tiles present. According to the hypothesis, In order to construct the output grid, we need to first count the exact number of unique colors that exist in the input grid. In this case, there are two unique colors. When there are two unique colors present, according to the hypothesis, the output grid should be a gray diagonal line going from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the 3x3 grid, with the rest of the grid being black tiles. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",

According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to first count the exact number of unique colors that exist in the input grid. In this case, there are three unique colors.
