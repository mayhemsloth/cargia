The input grid has a black background. and two purple objects that are in the shape of L's. These two L-shaped objects therefore have a directionality to them. and it seems like the output grid needs to add Purple tiles. in the diagonal direction the L shape into a square. but not including that tile. that would complete. For example, The top object here has the bottom left Tile missing that would complete the square therefore that direction diagonally is the chosen direction to include purple tiles in the output. We extend that pattern of a diagonal line until the edge of the output grid. Likewise, for the bottom purple object, square is the one that would need to be changed to purple to make it a square, so That's the direction that starts the diagonal purple line. The hypothesis is that there will be colored objects against a black background. are in the shape of an L. The directionality of that shaped L. determines the diagonal line. that need to be included in the output. along with the original L objects.",
    "b": "You can see again a black background with two L-shaped objects. In this case, their color is orange. directionality of the missing piece that would be included to create a square of that L-shaped object. dictates of the directionality of the diagonal line or that color that needs to be added in the output grid. the hypothesis still holds.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis now. background is still black, and in this case we have three L-shaped aqua objects. In each case we need to identify the tile that is missing that would complete it to be a square. In that determined diagonal direction, we add aqua tiles in a diagonal line until they hit the edge of the output grid, which is the same size as the input grid. The background stays black. and the original input L-shaped objects also are included in the output grid."
