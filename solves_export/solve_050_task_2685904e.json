  "thoughts": {
    "a": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. The output grid is almost an exact copy of the input grid but with some very slight changes. Thus immediately we notice that we are probably looking for some type of indicator or pattern that tells us where exactly we need to add colored tiles in the output grid. The background color is black in the input and output grids. There's a horizontal gray line near the middle of the input grid. Below that, there is multi-colored line composed of the colors red, green, and blue. The input grid also contains a horizontal aqua line in the top left corner. Very likely we will need to connect. this aqua line with some type of pattern that exists in the multicolor line. I'm not sure what the pattern is right now, so I don't have a solid hypothesis. the output grid has seemingly activated the two red tiles, and has grown a vertical red line above the gray horizontal line in the same column of that as the red tiles. I think I need to see another pair for additional information to make a hypothesis.",
    "b": "In the input grid, we again have a horizontal gray line across the middle of the grid. Additionally, below that line, there's a multicolored line of single tiles. The top left has an aqua tile, in this case one single tile. This pair has given me additional information about what could be the connection between the single aqua tile and the colors that get activated. We notice now that the vertical line that gets drawn in the output grid is only one tile tall. In the previous example pair, we noticed that the vertical line was two tiles tall, which corresponds to the number of tiles in the aqua line in the top left corner. So what's the connection for how we know which tiles get activated? Well, the hypothesis currently is that we identify the colors that have that many tiles in the multicolored line below the gray line. For example, in this pair, the aqua line is only one tile long. Therefore, we need to find any tile color in the multicolor line that has only a single one. Notice that we have three pink tiles, two yellow tiles, two red tiles, and two purple tiles. Finally, we have one blue tile. That one blue tile is the only tile that is activated to grow its vertical line above the gray line. In the previous pair, we now see that The multicolored line had two reds, four greens, and four total blue tiles. because the aqua line had two total tiles in it, we know that we activate only the red tiles to grow vertical lines above the horizontal gray tiles. Thus  this is now our working hypothesis. Input grid will contain a horizontal gray line. Below the horizontal gray line, there will be a multicolored horizontal line all on a black colored background. Finally, there will be some number of aqua tiles in the top left corner. the number of aqua tiles dictates both the height of the activated colors and which colors to activate We know which colors to activate based on the number of those tiles for that color in the multicolor line.",
    "c": "The input grid, as expected, contains a horizontal gray line. Below the horizontal gray line is a multicolor line. This multicolor line has three yellows, two blues, two greens, and three pinks in it. The aqua line in the top left is three tiles long. According to the hypothesis, This number three dictates two things It dictates the height of the activated grown vertical lines above the gray horizontal line and it also dictates which colors we choose to activate to grow these lines. The number three means that we need to find all the colors which have three tiles in the multicolor line. These colors are yellow and pink. That's for every yellow and pink tile, we construct a vertical line of that corresponding color in the same column above the gray horizontal line. The output grid is otherwise copied over as exactly the same, with the exception of these new vertical lines as created according to the hypothesis. Thus, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "The input grid has a black color background. It also has a horizontal gray line. Below this horizontal gray line, there is a multicolor horizontal line. In this case, there are five red tiles and four blue tiles contained in the multicolored line. The top left part of the input grid has four aqua tiles. Because of the number four, this dictates two things according to the hypothesis. Any color in the multicolored line that has four total tiles will be activated. In this case, that color is only blue. Additionally, the vertical line that is grown above the gray line needs to be four tiles tall. In the output grid, there will be four separate vertical blue lines, each of which are four tiles tall. They are located in the same column of the corresponding blue tiles in the multi-color line, but just above the grey horizontal line. Thus the hypothesis holds.",
    "e": "We notice in the multicolored line there are aqua line in the top left corner there are three total tiles therefore we're looking for in the multi-color line any color that has three total tiles of that color. The multicolored line contains two aqua tiles, one pink tile, two yellow tiles, two orange tiles, and three green tiles. Therefore, the green tiles are the only ones that are activated because there are three of them. According to the hypothesis, we grow a green vertical line above the gray horizontal line in the same column that The green tiles show up in the multicolored line. Thus the hypothesis holds.",
    "f": "The input grid has a black background again and a horizontal gray line as expected. multi-colored line is nearly all blue with eight blue tiles that has one green tile and one yellow tile top left aqua line is exactly one tile long. This number one dictates two things. According to that hypothesis, we need to select any color in the multicolored line that has exactly one tile of that color. In this case, it's both green and yellow. for all the green and yellow tiles that exist in the multicolored line. we grow a corresponding color vertical line above the gray horizontal line. Thus, the output grid in this case looks almost exactly as the input grid, but with just two additional tiles flipped to a different color, representing the vertical lines of height 1. Thus, the hypothesis holds.",
    "g": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black background. There's also the expected horizontal gray line and a multi-color line below that gray line. The aqua horizontal line in the top left corner has two tiles in it. Because of the number two here, the hypothesis says that we are now looking for the colors in the multicolored line that have exactly two tiles of that color. The multicolor line contains two red tiles, two pink tiles, two green tiles, three yellow tiles, and one purple tile. We have three separate colors that have exactly two tiles of that color. In this case, we have a red, pink, and green colors that are activated. For each color We must grow a vertical line above the gray horizontal line, in the same column as those activated colors. The lines are the corresponding colors, as the hypothesis says. In this case, we will end up with two green vertical lines, two red vertical lines and two pink vertical lines. The output grid is otherwise exactly the same as the input grid, with the exception of these specific grown vertical lines of height two."
