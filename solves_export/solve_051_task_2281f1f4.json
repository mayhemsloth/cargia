    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. We also notice that the Output Grid is basically an additive version of the Input Grid. meaning that the input grid is copied over exactly as is, with the exception of additional colored tiles. The input and output grids have a black color background. The input grid also has a scattering of gray tiles on the top and right edges. The output grid has additional red tiles. These red tiles are located in very specific locations. These specific locations are dictated by any intersection of the columns or rows that contain a gray tile on the edge. For example, if we were to imagine drawing or extending The gray tiles from the top edge down to the bottom edge. And additionally, imagine drawing or extending the gray tails on the right edge to the left edge any location that these lines would intersect are instead turned into red tiles. Thus, this is our hypothesis. The input grid will have a black background and some number of grey tiles on some of the edges. We must identify where the intersections are of these gray tiles on the edge if they were to be extended across the input grid. then wherever these would create intersections Those intersections are labeled as red. In this example, we have four gray tiles on the top edge and three gray tiles in the right edge. Thus, we expect 12 total intersections, 3 times 4. Indeed, in the output grid we have 12 total red tiles.",
    "b": "The input grid is a black color background. The top edge has three gray tiles and the right edge has... two gray tiles. Thus, we expect there to be six total red tiles in the output grid, because six is two times three. These red tiles are located at intersections of the imaginary lines that could be drawn across the input grid, if we were to extend the grey tiles vertically and horizontally. Notice that we don't extend them along the edge, horizontally or vertically Otherwise, we may also have a valid intersection in the top right corner. However, we do not. the hypothesis still holds but I just wanted to make that clarification note.",
    "c": "The input grid has a black color background with five gray tiles on the top edge, and four gray tiles on the right edge. The hypothesis says that we must identify the locations of all of the potential intersections of the imaginary lines that could be drawn from these edges. 4 times 5 is 20. Therefore, we expect 20 red tiles in the output grid. Indeed, we see 20 red tiles in the output grid. Additionally, they are at the intersections of these imaginary lines that are started from the gray tiles on the edges. Thus the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black color background. There are five gray tiles on the top edge and five gray tiles on the right edge of the input grid. According to the hypothesis, we need to act as if we extend these gray tiles across the input grid vertically and horizontally, And wherever these imaginary lines would intersect, we have to label them with red tiles. 5 times 5 is 25, therefore there should be 25 red tiles in the output grid. The rest of the output grid is exactly the same as the input grid."
