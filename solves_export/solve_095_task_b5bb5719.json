    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. This input grid is mainly an orange colored background with a single gray tile and a single red tile on the top row. The output grid is an exact copy of the input grid with the exception of one orange tile having been turned to red. This is probably the least amount of information you could possibly get in a training pair between the input and output grids: a single tile's color has changed. There must be some type of rule in the input grid that tells us which tile we need to select to turn to red. However we do not have a solid hypothesis with only one training pair with such little information given to us, and so more training pairs will be necessary to give a good guess.",
    "b": "The input and output grids are, again, the same sizes. The input grid contains orange color background with, in this case, two red tiles on the top row. The output grid is an exact copy of the input grid, except that there is now a gray tile in the second row in between the two red tiles. We didn't have a solid hypothesis from the first training pair, but now with two training pairs accessible, We can form a rough hypothesis now. The hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain an orange color background and two tiles in the top row, either gray or red. in order to construct the output grid we need to label a tile that is in between and below those two colored tiles in the top row, with either gray or red. Right now, in order to determine which color that tile should be, the hypothesis is that whenever the colors are the same, the tile should be gray. Whenever the top row tiles are different colors, the tile should be red. More training pairs would be helpful in strengthening this hypothesis.",
    "c": "Input grid has an orange color background and now has an entire top row colored in with red or gray tiles. Thus our hypothesis is incorrect, because the input grid doesn't contain just two tiles. We see now in the output grid that there is an entire construction of new tiles, not just a single new tile in the output grid. This seems to point to a type of operation that the first two training pairs are trying to teach us via the stripped down simplicity of the input and output grids, and this training pair is showing us that the operation is recursive and terminates only at the bottom of the output grid or when there's only one tile remaining in the row. For example, in the previous training pair, We learned that we need to fill in the next row below two tiles of the same color with the opposite color (two red tiles produces a gray tile, for example). If we inspect the output grid here, any time there are two tiles that are separated by a column, the next row down in that column has the opposite color. In the second row, we recurse this rule, and so the only valid pair are the two gray tiles in the second row, so then a red tile appears in the next row down between them. It seems like the first training pair in this task is telling us that whenever there are different colors, we choose the red one. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain an orange color background with some number of red or gray tiles in the top row. In order to construct the output grid, we perform an operation recursively to fill out the rest of the output grid as dictated by this operation. The operation involves placing gray or red tiles in the next row, according to the placement of the tile colors in the row above it. However, we need more training pairs to be confident in this new hypothesis.",
    "d": "The input grid has an orange color background and has only two non-background color tiles in the top row: red tile and gray tile. The output grid has a gray tile in the row below that top row, and in the column in between the pair of red and gray tiles. We learn from this training pair the rule abouty one of the cases while performing the operation in the hypothesis. Whenever a pair of tiles, separated by one column, appear in the same row and they are different non-background colors, then the new tile that appears in between them on the next row down takes from the right tile. In this case, the gray tile is on the right, so the new added tile will be gray. In the first training pair, the red tile was on the right, and the new tile was red as well. Because we only have one pair of tiles that we need to apply the recursive operation to, it terminates after a single application, and the output grid is exactly what we expect it to be. Thus the hypothesis holds.",
    "e": "The input grid has an orange colored background with the top row populated with either red or gray tiles. According to the hypothesis, we need to do an operation recursively to fill in the output grid with either red or gray tiles. The operation is described as adding a new tile in the row below any two gray or red tile pairs that are separated by a single column. When this is the case, we know we need to add a new red or gray tile. Whenever the two tiles are the same color, the new tile added is the other color. Whenever the two tiles are different colors, the new tile added is the same color as the tile on the right of the pair of tiles. Every row created will thus become fewer and fewer gray or red tiles, but we need to recursively build the rows down until there is a not any valid paris of separated-by-one-column non-background color tiles. We are finally confident in the hypothesis, as this output grid was exactly what we would expect with this rule applied.",
    "f": "This input and output grid pair is simply explicitly telling us what we had already inferred: in the case of the operation where there are two gray tiles in the valid pair, the new tile added is red. Because the output grid further supports our hypothesis with respect one of the edge cases in the rules, the hypothesis holds.",
    "g": "The input grid has an orange color background with the top row populated with either gray or red tiles. According to the hypothesis, we need to recursively do the operation that tells us how to populate the next row of tiles in the output grid. This operation involves pairs of non-background color tiles in the same row separated by a single column. Whenever this pair of tiles is the same color, the new tile is the other color. Whenever this pair of tiles have different colors, then the new tile is the color that comes from the right side of the pair of tiles. After building the second row, we need to recursively do this operation until we are left with no longer valid pairs of tiles in the same row. Because the output grid in this case is constructed via this described rule sequence, the hypothesis holds.",
    "h": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has an orange color background with the top row populated with either red or gray tiles. In this case, the top row is populated with gray tiles almost entirely except for the last column. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to recursively do an operation filling in the rows below the top row until we are left with only one or two tiles in some row. The operation involves two non-background color tiles in the same row that are separated by one column. The new tile placed in this column that separates these two tiles will be the dependent on the color of the two tiles in the pair. Whenever the color of the two tiles are the same, then the new tile added will be the other color. Whenever the color of the two tiles are different, then the new tile added will be the same color as the tile on the right of the pair. In this case, all the top row pairs will produce tiles in the second row of the color red, and then the recursively applied operation will produce a smaller row of gray, and then a smaller row of red, and then a smaller row of gray, and then a single red tile. This is because the original row in this input grid never had an instance of a pair of tiles with differing colors, so each row moving down will all be composed of a single color in the output grid."
