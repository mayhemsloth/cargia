The output grid is a three by three tile square containing all of the tiles of the bounding box that would contain a copy of the aqua object. That is, the output grid is simply the the aqua object, with the same shape, and with the appropriate black background tiles needed to represent it in the output grid. Note that this is not very much information, but because the input and output grids are drastically different sizes, and because the output grid is a copy of one of the objects in the input grid, we're probably looking for a selection rule that tells us from the contents of the input grid which object needs to be selected to be represented in the output grid. That is, how do we know that we had to select the aqua object in this case? Perhaps it's the largest object or the aqua object always. And what does the one yellow tiles do? Without more training pairs we can't make a solid hypothesis, so let's see additional training pairs.",
    "b": "The input grid is another black color background with an aqua object and now three single yellow tiles. The output grid is again a very different size than the input grid, but in this case we see three copies of the aqua object put horizontally next to each other. This helps to clarify the purpose of both the aqua object and the yellow tiles. In the previous training pair, the output grid contained one copy of the aqua object, and also the input grid contained one yellow tile. In this training pair, the output grid contains three copies of the aqua object and also the input grid contains three yellow tiles. This probably means that the aqua object is always selected to be copied, and the number of times it needs to be copied is determined by the number of yellow tiles present in the input grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will be mostly background tiles, probably black. There will also be an aqua object somewhere in the input grid, as well as some number of single yellow tiles scattered in the input grid. In order to construct the output grid, we need to count up the single yellow tiles and make that many copies of the aqua object, placed side by side as the output grid. The copies include the entire bounding box that is needed to contain that object, including any necessary background tiles to fill out that bounding box.",

According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to count up the single yellow tiles and make that many number of copies of the aqua object as the output grid. In this case, there are four yellow tiles. Therefore, we need four copies of the aqua object placed side by side. These copies are of the bounding box that contains the entirety of the aqua object, including any of the background tiles that are necessary to fill out the grid. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds",

These copies are of the bounding box that contains the entirety of the aqua object, including any of the background tiles that are necessary to fill out the grid. According to the hypothesis as stated, in the output grid we would expect only the grid to be two tiles high because the aqua object can be contained in a two tile tall rectangle. However, in this output grid we see that we still copy over a 3 tile tall bounding box section of the input that contains the aqua object. So it seems like we need to always copy over a 3x3 bounding box that happens to contain the entirety of the aqua object. Note that there is some ambiguity here in how we could place the aqua object relatively in the 3x3 tile bounding box. As long as there are only two possible choices of ambiguity, then we are fine as we can give two output grid guesses per test pair. In this case, there are only two possible choices. Either the aqua object can be in the bottom two rows of the 3x3 bounding box, or in the top two rows. This output grid says that it's in the bottom two rows. Thus the amended hypothesis is that we need to always copy over a 3x3 bounding box that contains the aqua object, the same number of times as there are yellow tiles in the input grid.",
