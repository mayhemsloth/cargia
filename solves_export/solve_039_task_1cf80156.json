We notice that the output grid also has a black background and the same blue object in the same orientation. However, the output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. Notice the output grid is the bounding box of the blue object, and contains the blue object. the rest of the input grid no longer exists in the output grid. The hypothesis is thus the following: The input grid will be a large grid with a black background and some number of blue or potentially other color objects. The output grid will be the minimal bounding box that completely encases that object or objects, with the background tiles being the same color and the object tiles also being the same color within the output grid.",
    "b": "The input grid, again, has a black background and a single non-background color object. This time the object is red. The output grid also has an exact replica of this red object, and is the same size as the bounding box that would contain this red object. Any non-red object tiles in the output grid are the background color, black in this case. Thus, the hypothesis holds. We are looking for the output grid to be an exact copy of the minimal bounding box that encases the non-background color object in the input grid.",
    "c": "Again, we have an input with a black background and this time an aqua object. The output grid is an exact copy of that aqua object without the rest of the input background. The output grid is only the shape of a bounding box that contains the aqua object. The hypothesis thus holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black background with a pink object of some shape. No matter what the shape is, we need to identify the minimal bounding box that contains this pink object. That minimal bounding box determines the output grid size and is indeed the entirety of the output grid. We copy over the internal parts of the bounding box, including the pink shape exactly as it is and the black background, as the output grid."
