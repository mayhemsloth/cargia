    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. The input grid has a black color background and a scattered variety of different colored square bounding boxes that can overlap each other. In this case, the largest is green, the next largest is aqua, the next largest is yellow, then blue, and then a single red tile which can be thought of as a 1x1 bounding box. We note that the entirety of the bounding box does not have to be contained within the input grid, but we know from the pattern established that the green bounding box is indeed a fully square bounding box that just happens to be off the input grid. The output grid is a different shape than the input grid, and it looks like the bounding boxes have been arranged in size order and placed within each other with a common center. In this case, the largest green bounding box square, a 9x9 square, defines the outer limits and thus the size of the output grid, and then the next largest, the aqua, is placed into the output grid next, followed by yellow, blue, and finally the single red tile in the middle. So the transformation looks to be about arranging the different sized square bounding boxes into each other in the output grid. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a background color, probably black. It will also contain a variety of different sized and different color bounding boxes. These bounding boxes may overlap each other and also may go off the edge of the input grid. However, there will be enough information to tell you how large the square bounding box is. In order to construct the output grid, we must identify the largest square bounding box in the input grid and use that size as the size of the output grid. The output grid is constructed by arranging the different sized bounding boxes from largest to smallest, in a nesting, non overlapping way, with all having the same center tile in the output grid.",
    "b": "The input grid contains a black color background and a variety of different square bounding boxes. The largest square bounding box is red, and the next largest is aqua, and the next largest is green, and finally there's a two by two yellow square bounding box. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we must identify the largest square bounding box in the input grid and use that as the size of the output grid. In this case, the output grid will be 8 by 8 because the red square bounding box is 8 by 8. The output grid is constructed by placing the square bounding boxes into the output grid in a nesting structure from largest to smallest. In this case, the outermost tiles in the output grid will be red, and then aqua, and then green, and then finally yellow. The bounding boxes in the output grid don't overlap and are centered within each other. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a black color background and a variety of different square bounding boxes of different sizes. The largest square bounding box is pink, and the next largest is green, and the next largest is aqua, and then yellow and then finally a 2x2 square red bounding box. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we must identify the largest square bounding box in the input grid and use that as the size of the output grid. In this case, the output grid will be 10 by 10 because the largest square bounding box, the pink one, is 10 by 10. The output grid is constructed by placing the square bounding boxes into the output  grid in a nesting structure from largest to smallest. In this case, the outermost tiles will be pink, and then green, and then aqua, and then yellow, and then finally red. The bounding boxes in the output grid will not overlap and are centered within each other."
