    "a": "The input and output grids are the same, and they have roughly the same shapes or objects inside of them, So we are likely looking at a type of translation rule. Notice in the input grid there are four green tiles that make a bounding box. These are the corners of a bounding box. There's also a red object that passes through the edge of this bounding box. Note that the edge isn't actually green all the way around, but we can imagine that the lines where the edges are could be green. Instead, they are currently The color of the background, which is black. The output grid contains these exact Green in the exact locations of the input grid. However, the red object has been moved down in the green bounding box and contained entirely within it. We note that the bounding box created by the green tiles, which act as the corners of this bounding box, Create a 7x7 bounding box. the red object is entirely within a 5x5 Square. A five by five square is entirely contained within a seven by seven square. Thus, the hypothesis is the following, the input grid will have some type of colored tiles, in our case they were green, that represent the corners of a bounding box of some size. It will also be an additional object in the input grid. For the output grid, that object needs to be placed entirely within the bounding box established by the single tile corners.",
    "b": "The input grid again contains four green single tiles. These green single tiles create a rectangular bounding box. According to the hypothesis, there should also be an additional object And there is. It is a red object. that can be contained entirely within the bounding box created by the green tiles corners. As for the output grid, we need to Translate the red object and move it into the bounding box of the green tile corners. That's what's shown in the output grid, and therefore the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid again has four single tile green corners that establish a bounding box. Additionally, the input grid has a red object against the black color background. This red object can entirely fit in the bounding box established by the green corner tiles. Thus, according to the hypothesis, we need to move the red object into the bounding box established by the green tiles. Because this perfectly describes the output grid, the hypothesis still holds.",
    "d": "The input grid has a black color background. It also has four single green tiles that establish a bounding box. The input grid also has a red object. that can be fit entirely into the bounding box created by the green corner tiles. We need to translate this red object as is such that it is fit entirely into the bounding box. The output grid is this exact translation, Filling in with tiles with background color where the object used to be. the hypothesis thus holds.",
    "e": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a black background and four green tiles that dictate the boundaries of a bounding box. Additionally, there is a red object of some shape. According to the hypothesis, we know that the output grid has to be this red object. entirely contained within the bounding box established by the green corner tiles. In this case, the red object is moved to the right by one single column. The rest of the input grid stays the same with the exception that whatever tiles are emptied by the movement of the red object we fill those in with black background instead."
