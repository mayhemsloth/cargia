  "thoughts": {
    "a": "The input and output grids are different sizes. We notice that the output grid is four by four, and the input grid has four rows and 19 columns. The input grid seems to be sectioned off into multiple subsections of four by four squares. You can tell this is the case because there are Three vertical green lines that go from the top edge to the bottom edge of the input grid. These are acting as boundaries or separators that are specifically sectioning the input into different subsections. Each subsection has one color and one background color, which happens to be black. Sections colors go from left to right, aqua, gray, purple, and yellow. We notice in the output grid there is also aqua, yellow, purple, and the background color black. because the subsections of the input grid are the same size as the total of the output grid, and because of the presence of the variety of colors in those subsections in the output grid, I think the output grid is constructed via some overlapping or stacking rule of the subsections. If we stacked the subsections on top of each other from left to right, placing the ones to the right on top of the ones to the left, then we would should end up with a lot of yellow in the output grid. And we don't see that, so that can't be the case. If we stack instead from right to left, placing the ones on the left on top of the ones to the right in that order, then the last to be placed would be the large aqua section, overlapping most of the other tiles and being the most prominent in the output grid. We don't see that either in the output grid, and therefore it can't be right. Perhaps the color of the sections themselves determine the order. Notice there are no gray tiles in the output. this implies all of them have been covered up in the stacking sequencing. Notice as well that the purple section has all of its tiles showing in the output grid. Finally, notice that the yellow tiles are shown in the output grid where there are some in the corresponding aqua subsection locations, which likely means that yellow goes on top of aqua. So the hypothesis, for now, is the following. Input grid will have Subsections of equal size, where each subsection is a black background and a different color object in it. Subsections are separated by green vertical lines. The output grid is constructed by Stacking or overlapping the different subsections in this specific order: Grey, Aqua, yellow, then purple. What I mean by that is that we one by one construct the output grid by taking the tiles positions of each color, and replacing them with the next color wherever they exist. Because we start with gray, we can imagine gray as the base layer. Next, the aqua layer comes on top, flipping any values in our stack to the aqua color, and allowing any already present gray or background color to persist. Then we do the same for yellow, and then for purple. Because the rest of the colors have tiles in all the places that the grey subsection has tiles, it means that the output grid will not have any grey tiles present, which is true. I would like some more pairs to more strongly support this hypothesis, specifically the color dependent sequencing.",
    "b": "The input grid is again a sequence of 4x4 subsections that have been seaparated by green vertical lines that act as separators or barriers defining the different subsections, with black as the background color. we see the same four colors, aqua, gray, purple, and yellow in the same order in the input grid. In this pair, there are different tiles activated as those colors in the respective subsections. According to the hypothesis, we need to construct the output grid by stacking the different subsections on top of each other in a specific order. According to the hypothesis currently, that order is gray, Aqua, yellow, and then purple. Notice again that the purple subsections tiles are completely represented in the output grid exactly as is, pretty strongly supports the hypothesis. Additionally, even though the gray subsection has a bunch of tiles in it this time, there's still only one in the output grid, which means the other colors are stacking on top of the gray layer and covering them up. I believe the hypothesis holds. We need to construct the output grid using a specific order of subsection stacking, overwriting the non-background colors with the higher stacked layers.",
    "c": "Input grid is again a sequence of four by four subsections that have been separated by green vertical lines. These vertical lines act as separators or barriers defining the different subsections. The subsections have the colors aqua, gray, purple, and yellow again. According to the hypothesis, we construct the output grid, which is the same size as one of the subsections of the input grid, by stacking the different subsections in a specific sequence top of each other, almost acting like a stack of broken windows or filters. That specific sequence is gray, aqua, yellow, and then purple. Indeed, looking at the input grid subsections and the output grid, This hypothesis still holds. Notice that in the output grid, wherever there is a black background color, none of the subsections had a colored tile in that location, and thus it was never covered up in the stacking sequence.",
    "d": "Input grid is again what we expect, sequence of 4x4 subsections that have been separated by green vertical lines. According to the hypothesis we construct the output grid by stacking these different subsections together on top of each other Following order, gray, aqua, yellow, then purple. Looking at the input grid And the locations of all the subsections colors, and looking at the output grid, we see that the hypothesis still holds.",
    "e": "Yet again, this pair supports the hypothesis further. The input grid is exactly what we expect, and the output grid is also exactly what we expect. I'm at this point very confident in the hypothesis for this puzzle.",
    "f": "This pair also supports the hypothesis further. We need to construct the output grid with a sequence of stacking of the different subsections. That specific subsection sequence is gray, aqua, yellow, and then purple, with gray being on the bottom and therefore most likely to be fully covered up.  Looking at the output grid, it is again the expected colors in the expected places when we construct it via the hypothesis of stacking the colored subsections.",
    "g": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains four subsections, as expected, separated by green vertical lines. According to the hypothesis, we need to construct the output grid, which is 4 by 4, stacking the different subsections on top of each other, overwriting the different non-background colors as they appear. Specific sequence of stacking is gray on the bottom, then aqua on top of that, then yellow on top of that, and then purple on top of that. Once we stack these different subsections on top of each other we end up with the output grid."
