    "a": "Input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid has a yellow color background and some number of mainly blue colored shapes. In this case, there are two mainly blue color objects. Each of these objects has one non-blue tile in it. Scattered amongst the input grid are also single tiles of various colors. In this case, there are three gray tiles, two green tiles, and one pink tile. We notice in the output grid there are now two copies of one of the mainly blue colored objects, and all the scattered single tiles are gone from the output grid. Additionally, the mainly blue colored objects have moved from their original locations and no longer appear in their original locations in the output grid. In the input grid, there was a single pink tile and two green tiles, and now in the output grid there is a single copy of the mainly blue object with a pink tile and there are two copies of the mainly blue object with a green tile. We note also that in the output grid the single green tiles are in the same locations as they appeared in the input grid, but now the corresponding mainly blue object has formed around it. Thus the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some color background in this case, yellow. There will be some number of mainly blue objects scattered in the input grid, and each object will contain exactly one tile that is not blue and not the background color. Gathered amongst the input grid will also be a variety of single tile colors. In order to construct the output grid, we must make copies of the mainly blue colored objects and place them into the appropriate position in the output grid such that the alternate color tiles within that object aligns with the corresponding color of the scattered single tiles. The rest of the scattered single tile colors that are not used are removed from the output grid and replaced with the background color. The original locations of the mainly blue objects are also removed. This is a complex hypothesis so we hope that additional training pairs will further support it or clarify it.",
    "b": "The input grid again has a yellow-colored background with a variety of mainly blue objectss scattered in it. In this case, there are three separate objects with mainly blue tiles and one non-blue tile. One object has a red tile, one object has a green tile, and another object has an aqua tile. The input grid also contains two red single tiles, two gray single tiles, one green single tile and one aqua single tile scattered in the input grid. According to the hypothesis, We need to copy over the mainly blue objects and put them into the appropriate locations in the output grid. Appropriate locations are dictated by the alternate tile color of each blue object. For example, in this case one of the mainly blue objects is a 3x3 square with a red centered tile. This object needs to be recreated in every place where there is a red single tile in the input grid. In this case, there are two in the input grid. Specifically this object needs to be recreated with the relative location of the alternate tile color in the exact same location as the single red tile in the input grid, in all the places where the single red tiles appear, in this case the two places. correspondingly for every other will mainly blue object, We need to identify their alternate tile color and then recreate that object. in the exact appropriate location. Note that in the output grid, the unused single tile colors are changed to the yellow background color and the original location of the mainly blue shapes also do not persist and are changed to yellow tiles. Because the output graded contains exactly what we expect it to, the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid has a yellow colored background and a variety of different colored objects, including mainly blue objects and mainly red objects. Each object has an alternate color tile. One blue object has an alternate pink tile, another has a green tile, and the mainly red object has an aqua tile. Although the hypothesis mentions only mainly blue objects, because we have two tries at answering, we should try two separate answers, one with the hypothesis applied to only blue objects, and the other answer with the hypothesis applied to the mainly blue and mainly red objects. Recall that in order to construct the output grid, we need to identify all the alternate tile colors in the objects and use them as positional locators to make copies of those objects in the exact appropriate locations of the corresponding single tile colors that were scattered in the input grid. The unused single tile colors should be eliminated from the output grid and replaced with yellow background tiles. Additionally, the original objects as they appear in the input grid no longer persis in the output grid. Again, in one attempt at the answer we should copy over into the appropriate locations only the two mainly blue objects, and in the second attempt at the answer should copy over the two mianly blue and one mainly red object into all of their appropriate locations."
