    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. The input grid looks like it has two subsections in it. The top subsection has a black color background and three single color tiles, red, aqua and yellow. The bottom aubsection has a green color background and a scattering of different color and shaped objects. There are blue, red, aqua, and yellow objects in this bottom subsection. We note that there are colored objects represented in the bottom subsection for all the colors in the top subsection with the exception of blue. The output grid looks very similar to the input grid, with the exception of some additional tiles in the top subsection and the removal of the blue object in the bottom subsection. The only missing object in the bottom subsection is the object that has no corresponding color in the top subsection. The top of subsections single tiles are now all line of various lengths. The red line is four tiles long, the aqua line is two tiles long, and the yellow line is one tile long. How do we know how long the output grid line should be? If we look closely at the input grid, we notice that there are exactly four red object, two aqua objects, and one yellow object in the input grid's bottom subsection. These numbers exactly correspond to the length of the corresponding colors line in the top subsection. The top subsection of the input grid is effectively selecting which colored object we need to count the number of and record that count in the output grid's top subsection, while also removing any object that has not been requested to be counted. Thus, the hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain a top subsection and bottom subsection, where each will have a different colored background, probably black on top and green on bottom. The top subsection will contain some number of individual single non-background colored tiles, which we will refer to as counting tiles because they represent which colored objects we need to count and record in the output grid. The bottom subsection of the input grid will contain some number of colored objects, some of which will be the same colors as those single counting tiles. In order to construct the output grid, we need to count the total number of colored objects for each of the counting tiles, and then record the total number in the length of the line of the corresponding color, adding additional tiles to the right of the original counting tiles, such that the total length is equal to the total number of individual objects of that color. Any object in the bottom subsection that is not requested to be counted via the existence of a counting tile will be removed and replaced with the background color of the bottom subsection. The rest of the objects in the bottom section stay exactly where they are, and the output grid is the same size as the input grid.",
    "b": "The input grid contains a top subsection with a black color background and a bottom subsection with a blue colored background. The top subsection has three individual single-colored tiles, yellow, red, and green. According to the hypothesis, these single tiles are the counting tiles. The bottom subsection contains red, green, and aqua objects. Specifically, it contains three green objects, two red objects, and one aqua object. Notably, it does not contain any yellow objects, even though that was one of the requested counting tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively count the number of objects that exist in the bottom subsection of the input grid that is the same color as each counting tile and record this count for each of the corresponding colors in the top section of the output grid. In this case, the output grid should contain a red line that is two tiles long because there are two red objects in the bottom subsection. The output grid should also contain a green line that is three tiles long because there are three green objects in the bottom subsection. Additionally, any object whose color has not been requested to be counted should be removed from the output grid and replaced with the appropriate background color, which in this case is blue. In this case, we see in the output grid that the yellow counting tile no longer exists in the top subsection in the output grid. This must be because there were no corresponding yellow objects in the bottom subsection of the input grid, and thus zero is the correct number of yellow objects and so the yellow line should be zero length in the output grid, which means it does not exist anymore. Although such a case was not explicitly shown in the first training pair, this development is consistent with the general theme of the hypothesis, which is to count the number of colored objects of the requested counting tiles and then make that colored line the length. Thus the hypothesis holds.",
    "c": "The input grid contains a top subsection with a black color background and a bottom subsection with an aqua color background. The top subsection has three individual single colored tiles, blue, red, and yellow. According to the hypothesis, these single tiles are the counting tiles. The bottom subsection contains red, yellow, blue, pink, and green objects. Specifically, it contains four yellow objects, two blue objects, two red objects, two pink objects, and one green object. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively count the number of objects that exist in the bottom subsection of the input grid, which is the same color as each counting tile, and record this count for each of the corresponding colors in the top section of the output grid by making the line starting from each counting tile the same length as the total number of objects of that color. In this case, the output grid should contain a blue line that is two tiles long because there are two blue objects in the bottom subsection. Accordingly, the output grid should contain a red line that is two tiles long and a yellow line that is four tiles long. Additionally, any object whose color has not been requested to be counting should be removed from the output grid and replaced with the appropriate background color, which in this case is aqua. All the rest of the counted objects remain, and the output grid should be the same total size as the input grid. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. The input grid contains a top subsection with a black color background and a bottom subsection with a yellow color background. The top subsection has three individual single colored tiles of red, aqua, and green. According to the hypothesis, these single tiles are the counting tiles. And the bottom subsection contains red, green, orange, and gray objects. Specifically, it contains five red objects, two green objects, one orange object, and one gray object. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to effectively count the number of objects that exist in the bottom subsection of the input grid that is the same color as each counting tile. We record this count for each of the corresponding colors in the top section of the output grid by making the line starting from each countint tile the same length as the total number of objects of that color. In this case, the output grid should contain a red line that is of length 5 because there are 5 total red objects in the bottom subsection. Additionally, the output grid should contain a green line that is two tiles long because there are two green objects in the bottom subsection. We identify no aqua objects in the bottom subsection, and therefore we should remove the aqua counting tile and replace it with the black background color tile in the top subsection of the output grid. Any of the other objects in the bottom subsection should also be removed and replaced with the yellow background color in the output grid. Specifically, these are the orange and gray objects. Any of the counted objects remain, and the output grid is the same size as the input grid."
