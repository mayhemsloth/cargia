    "a": "The input grid and the output grids are different sizes. Input grid is a bunch of seemingly random colored tiles. The output grid has similar colors as well. We notice that the output grid is a copy of the top right section of the input grid. So perhaps the hypothesis is simply that the output grid is the top right section of the input grid. In this case, the input grid is 4x4 and the output grid is 2x2. So perhaps the actual hypothesis is that the output grid is top right quarter of the input grid. We will need to confirm with additional example pairs.",
    "b": "Our hypothesis was definitely wrong. The input grid is 3 by 3 here, and the output grid is 2 by 2. The output grid happens to be the 2x2 subsection of the input grid from the top left corner. Likely the colors themselves have to do with dictating What subsection of the input grid to put as the output grid. However, from these two pairs alone, I do not see a reasonable hypothesis to guide us. It is still seemingly random. Perhaps another example pair will help us to figure this out.",
    "c": "in this example pair, The input grid is a 5x5 square, and the output grid is again a 2x2 square. We notice that the output grid is a subsection of the input grid, specifically the top left corner. I still am failing to see any coordination of how to select the subsection of the input grid to be the output grid answer. It seems like there must be some rule that dictates from the input grid colors or arrangement of tiles which subsection of the input grid to use as the output grid answer. Even looking at only the output grids, there's seemingly no pattern from all the pairs. Certain output grids have repeated colors, others have none. Certain output pairs have black tiles. Others do not. I'm very much stumped with this. I am mainly stumped because the input grid is seemingly random. I cannot find any pattern or symmetry in any of the input grids across any of the sample pairs, especially patterns or symmetries that might point me to how to select the 2x2 grid subsection as the output grid answer. So let's take a step back and assume the colors don't matter at all. Usually they do, but let's say they don't. What other information do we have? What if the size of the input grid itself was the code that told us how to select? In the first pair, we have a 4x4 input grid, which is an even number of columns and rows, and that selected the top right 2x2 grid. In the second pair, we have a 3x3 input grid. that's an odd number of columns and rows, and that pair selected the top left 2x2 subsection as the output grid. In this example pair, the input grid is a 5x5 grid, which has an odd number of columns and rows. The output grid selected is the top left 2x2 subsection. Perhaps that is it then! The hypothesis is that if the input grid has an even number of rows and columns, then we select the top right 2x2 subsection as the output grid, exactly copying as is. If the input grid has an odd number of rows and columns, then we select the top left 2x2 subsection as the output grid, exactly copying whatever is in there as is. That's the current working hypothesis because it fits all the example pairs so far.",
    "d": "We apply our hypothesis here. We count the number of columns and rows in the input grid. The input grid is an 8x8 square. Eight is an even number. According to the hypothesis, whenever we encounter an input grid with an even number, we must select the top right 2x2 subsection of the input grid and use that as the output grid exactly. So in this case, the output grid will be a 2x2 grid of tiles with the top left tile being purple, the top right tile being red, the bottom left tile being green, and the bottom right tile being yellow, This is exactly a copy of the top right subsection of the input grid."
