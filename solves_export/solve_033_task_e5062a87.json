    "a": "Input grid and output grid are the same size. The input and output grids also look very similar, with some slight changes. So very likely we are looking for some type of rule that determines exactly which tiles in the input grid need to be changed to a new color. The input grid is a bunch of gray and black tiles that are scattered, seemingly randomly. However, there is a single horizontal line of four red tiles in the input grid, and in the output grid there is a copy of that red horizontal line. My hypothesis is that there will be an input grid of gray and black tiles, and some shape of red tiles. In this case it was a horizontal line. Then need to identify in the input grid wherever that shape can be placed into black background tiles. And wherever that shape can be additionally placed, that is what is shown in the output grid. In this case, in the input grid, we identify only one place where four horizontal black tiles are shown, and those four tiles are change to red. This represents us copying the initial red object into all available locations where they can be placed in the black background. The gray tiles act as a type of overlay layer that does not allow the red object to be placed there.",
    "b": "the hypothesis holds for this pair. The input grid is an assortment of black and gray tiles. There's a single red object which in this case is four tiles arranged in a plus sign with the center tile missing. The output grid is an exact copy. of the input grid, but Wherever this. plus sign can be placed into the black. Background tiles. Those black background tiles are changed to red. So we must scan through the input grid and identify wherever this shape appears in the black background tiles, and then color those black background tiles red in the output grid. In this case, there are four additional such instances where the red plus sign can fit.",
    "c": "The hypothesis still holds in this case. The input grid is a bunch of gray and black tiles with one red object, in this case, an L-shaped object of four red tiles. The goal is then to identify in the input grid wherever this exact shape without rotating would fit into the black background. Wherever it would fit in the output grid, we need to color those black background tiles red instead of black. We identified three such locations, and thus in the output grid there are now four red L-shaped objects, three additional ones and the original one. The rest of the input grid stays the same.",
    "d": "We apply the hypothesis here. In the input grid, there are a bunch of gray and black tiles. We need to identify the red object. In this case, it's a two column wide and three row tall red rectangle. according to the hypothesis we now need to examine the input grid and attempt to find any place or location where this rectangle object can fit into the black background. Note that the gray tiles are not valid locations for the additional red objects to be placed. We identified two such additional locations, one all the way on the left and one all the way on the right. In the output grid, we thus need to copy the input grid exactly with the exception that those two locations of black background will be changed to red, because They represent us copying the initial red rectangle object and placing them into the that are allowable."
