    "a": "The input and output grids are the same sizes. Input grid is a 3x3 square and contains a black color background with four gray tiles in a sideways L shape. The output grid is also a 3x3 square with black colored tiles and now yellow tiles. The shape of the black tiles in the output grid matches the shape of the gray tiles in the input grid, and the shape of the yellow tiles in the output grid matches the shape of the black tiles in the input grid. Very likely we are simply swapping the colors of tiles from the input grid to the output grid, but we need to learn the map that tells us which colors correspond to which new colors. For example, this training pair tells us that the gray color in the input grid means the background color should be changed to yellow in the output grid, and the gray tiles will be changed to the background color. We should see more training pairs before making a full hypothesis about the color transformations.",
    "b": "The input grid contains black tiles and aqua tiles, and the output grid in this case contains red and black tiles. As expected, they are both 3x3 tile squares. According to our working hypothesis, we expect the aqua tiles in the input grid to be changed to the background color black, and then the background tiles in the input grid to be changed to some other color that pairs with the aqua color. That color seems to be red. Thus our hypothesis is the following. The input grid will contain some number of black color background tiles and another tile color, either aqua, gray, red, or yellow. The output grid should be the same size as the input grid and have their colors changed according to the pairs of color transformation that we have seen so far. When aqua tiles are present in the input grid, the black background tiles should change to red in the output grid, while the original aqua tiles will change to black. Likewise, the gray and yellow pairs of colors will follow the same color transformation rule to construct the output grid. We are assuming that red may also show up in the input grid, and likewise the red tiles will be changed to the black background color while the background tiles will be changed to the paired color of aqua. More training pairs will support this hypothesis and could potentially introduce more color pairs.",
    "c": "The input grid is a 3x3 square with black and aqua tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to follow the color pair transformation rule which says that the aqua color is paired with the red color. Thus for the output grid all aqua tiles in the input grid is changed to the black background color, and all black background tiles in the input grid should be changed to the red color. Because this is exactly what we see in the output grid, the hypothesis holds.",
    "d": "The input grid is a 3x3 square with black and green tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to follow the color pair transformation rule which currently does not mention any green color. Therefore this training pair is teaching us about a new color pair, which is green and blue. Whenever green or blue tiles show up in the input grid, then the output grid should be the other such color, while following the way to apply these paired colors. Specifically, the black background color tiles in the input grid all become the corresponding pair color, in this case blue, while all the green tiles will become the black background tile color. The hypothesis holds and we now have three color transformation pairs. Green and blue. Then aqua and red. Then gray and yellow.",
    "e": "The input grid is a 3x3 square with gray and black tiles. According to the hypothesis, in order to construct the output grid, we need to follow the color pair transformation rule which pairs the gray color with the yellow color. Thus wherever there are gray tiles in the input grid, they should be changed to the black color background tiles in the output grid, and wherever there are black color background tiles in the input grid, those tiles should be changed to the paired color of yellow tiles in the output grid. Because this is exactly what we see, the hypothesis holds.",
