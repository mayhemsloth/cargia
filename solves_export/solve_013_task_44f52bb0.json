I think we need more examples to really. develop a hypothesis here. So let's see the next example pair.",

My hypothesis is that there is some feature of the input grid red tiles. are indicating something. That needs to be. True about the input in totality such that the output grid flag is colored either. blue or orange.",

From these three pairs, I now notice that there is some type of Symmetry in the first pair that had an output of blue and there is no such symmetry in the outputs that are orange. So my hypothesis right now is that if the input grid red tiles exhibit some type of horizontal or vertical symmetry with respect to the grid itself, Then the output. Indicator single one by one tile will be blue. Otherwise, it will be orange.",

Because of this arrangement, this input grid exhibits no internal symmetry, either vertical or horizontal, and therefore the output grid should be a 1x1 indicator tile of orange.",
